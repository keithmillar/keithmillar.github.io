<p>Flo and I went to the vets Lunch in the Esplanade, this was the first time Flo had been to one of these and I several years since I had been to one. Turned out not too bad food was good but as usual service was slow. This year the Club had laid on a comedian, heard worse.

<p>On Friday the 9th we headed down to Cork, via a visit to Trish. The traffic was quit heavy and the weather was pretty poor but we made it in time for tea. Then the Briar Rose where we meet with John and Mairead for a couple of drinks and a chat about their up coming planes for Spain next year.</p>
<p>On Sat we went for a walk with Karen and Lola down by the river nice day and not too busy in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Mon after lunch we finally got on the road to Wexford, done the normal thing here Wexford shopping, movies and lunch before heading home on Wednesday afternoon, in far from ideal driving conditions and very heavy traffic round Dublin which only eased after Ballbriggan.</p>
<p>Sat 17 we went to the Bokhara with the Hawe Rd group, first we had drinks in Keiths house which set use up for the evening.</p>
<p>Wed 21 saw us in Belfast for our pre Christmas fun, coffee in the linen Hall then a wander round the town finishing in Murels for some grub and a couple of hot whiskies to ease my cold.</p>
<p>Thu 22 we got news that Flos Mother was not too well, waiting for an update tomorrow to see what happening.</p>
<p>Sat 24 Got word Florence was not doing too well. Arrived Cork around 18:00 and went straight to the ICU saw Florence Sr, then collected Adreane from the Airport and went back to the Hospital. We spent the next few days back and forward to the Bons, but there was little improvement in Florence Sr over the weekend.</p>
<p>Boxing Day and we where told by the Doctors to expect the worse, as Florence was not going to get better. 21:35 was finally the end, very peaceful for Florence Sr.</p>
<p>Florence Sr Funeral was today Wed 29. The weather was good which helped in the cemetery and the Flowers looked nice.</p>
<p>Spent the next few days just doing things, I though it would be a good idea to go into Cork on Friday for a change of scenery which we did, some coffee and a look round the shops helped a bit. Sat was New years Eve so John and Mairead came round and we got a carry out and some beer and saw the New Year in form Oakdene.</p>
