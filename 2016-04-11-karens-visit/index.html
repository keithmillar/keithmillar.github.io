Karen Arrived late on Wed night so off to bed and ready for tomorrow.</p>
<p>A late breakfast and we all went to Montroy Castle and reoriented ourself with the layout of the land, then down to Real for a Coffee, then back home and the Bar La Rambla where we had the Menu del Dia.</p>
<p>We spent the evening in Bonaire Shopping Centre.</p>
<p>My Yoga class has finished which meant we could do Flo&rsquo;s Altury Agri walk which Lotti had to miss as we had another walk planned for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Early start for us saw us in Cortes de Pallas just after 10:00, lovely day but strong wind was blowing which kept the tempature down. Lotti enjoyed her day as well but was well tired at the end and to cap the day off we enjoyed a nice meal in La Forcat, Alborache.</p>
<p>Lovely morning and our first Breakfast out on the Porch. A short walk with a very tired and warm Lotti. Then off to the Airport with Karen.</p>
