<p>Having set a date to return we we are now biting our nails in case their are any more delays with the roof.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020/2020-09-17-back-home.jpg" alt="Roof Finished"><strong>Roof Finished</strong></p>
<p>The roof has been finished, now we are frantically doing lots of jobs in preparation of returning home on the 17th.
Even with our tight schedule we snuck in a quick visit to see Maxi and Naama, Maxi was doing well and happy too see us.</p>
<p>Not knowing what to expect travelling north we pre booked all our stop overs, to some degree this put us on a tight schedule but I am sure we will manage. Once we dismantled the solar panels and locked up we where on the road for 11:30.</p>
<p>After a coffee and then a fuel stop we arrived in Urdos at 19:15, great site on the French Pyrenees in a narrow valley very dark and excellent for star gazing.</p>

<p>Up and off at 09:30 another long days driving arriving at Camping Le Martin Pechur near Nort, what I didn&rsquo;t expect was the temperature 34c and we had no chair to sit out and enjoy it.</p>
<p>Camping L&rsquo;Esperance at 16:25 a bit cooler here being on the coast, Lotti enjoyed a walk on the beach the first in over a year. Nice site recent refurb enjoyed chips in the bar.</p>
<p>Leisurely drive to the ferry terminal, and eventually on to the boat, due to covid-19 we spent most of our time in the cabin watching movies only leaving for food and check on Lotti.</p>
<p>Once we arrived in Dublin Flo took us straight to Harry and Caths for a long over due vist, good thing to as they where about to enter a stricter lockdow and visiting would be a no no.</p>
<p>Uneventful drive home stopping in Tesco for much need grocery shopping and on to our 14 day isolationi.</p>
<p>Once our isolation was finished I got appointments with the Dentist and optician, one tooth removed and new glasses ordered.</p>
