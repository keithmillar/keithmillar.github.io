<strong>Walls Of Derry</strong></p>
<p>Week two and we found ourselves in the Everglades Hotel Londonderry, arriving quite late after a trip to Chain Reaction Cycles and a lovely lunch in the Galgorm Manor. Once we had checked in to the hotel Flo was busting a gut to explore the Walls of Derry, after finding a parking place off we set. Walking through a deserted town center past the Guild Hall we climb on to the walls, taking a anti-clockwise course we explored the walls. Lots of work has gone into the upkeep of the walls and it was a worthwile visit, I was surprised by how small the city was. Not being able to find somewhere to go for a drink we headed back to the hotel .</p>
<p>Next morning we drove into Donegal and did a lap of the Inishowen Peninsula. Fort Dunree was our main stopping point this time. An old Fort which has been turned in to a Military museum with detailed exhibitions, many restored guns, and a rotting military camp. Worth a visit as it explanes its value to both the British and Irish Goverments both before and after the two World Wars.</p>
<p>Then I remembered that we where close to the Mamore Gap which is part of the tour of Inishowen, sure enough it was a epic looking climb but I was more taken by the decent which would  be a much more severe climb.</p>
<p>Heading back to Londonderry and then through Letterkenny to Milford and tonights hotel. Having checked in earley it was back to the car and The Fanad Peninsula this was much nicer than the Inishowen Peninsula. Driving up to Fanad Head Lighthouse and the rain showers where getting heavier by the minute.</p>

<p>Continuing around the Peninsula we had fantastic views over Lough Swilly to the Inishowen Peninsula and Fort Dunree where  we visited earlier in the day. The heavy showers provided us with some very atmospheric photos with great rainbows.</p>

<p>We decided on Thursday to drive home via the north coast and stopped in Portstewart for coffee. Port Ballintoy next for ice cream, then home.</p>
