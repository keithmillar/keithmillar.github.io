<p>We took Lotti to the Vet&rsquo;s this morning for her 4 week check up.</p>
<p>{{ more }}</p>
<p>Dropping her off at 9:35 without any breakfast did not go down well, after the initial meet and greet she would have happily come back home with us, however that wasn&rsquo;t to be.</p>
<p>After reviewing her x-ray the vet was very happy with her progress all seem well we can now increase the length of her walks over the new four weeks when she will have another appointment with the vet.</p>
