<br><br>
<p>Dropped the Keanes at the airport and collected Flo, stopped at the aire in Turis and fill enough water bottles to last until we go home.</p>
<p>All our visitors have gone home which leaves us free once again. No more trips to the airport this trip.</p>
<p>Before we new it Easter has arrived and with it the heavy rain in over 50yrs, nearby town Algemes√≠ recorded 300 ltrs per meter squared over a 24 hour period needless to say we didn&rsquo;t go out much.</p>
<p>We decided on stress relieving retail therapy and spent a day in Valencia shopping and nice Italian meal in Romeo and Juliets, proper Italian.</p>
<p>Circuit Tormo for the Spanish CVE championship a free event on a glorious day with some good racing. We stopped off at Finca el Porton for Almurtzo on the way to the circuit. The main reason for comming here was to scope out our desired seating for the Motogp which we did, only to find our choice was severely limited but we still book our seats.</p>
