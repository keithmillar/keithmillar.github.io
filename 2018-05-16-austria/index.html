<p>A short run from Hall to St Johann and a nice site just outside the town with great views of the surrounding mountains. Lots of changes with new hotels and shops but the core of the town is still the same, Hotel Fisher in witch we stayed 13yrs ago is still here as is the rain.</p>

<p>Visited the town market which was pretty mediocre then in the afternoon the pair of us went for a cycle on the master RR course naturally it pissed down on us. Once home and showered the sun has burst through and we are dinning outside in tee shirts and shorts.</p>

<p>Off once again to Italy, via the Grossglockner and tonights stop in San Candido the Groslockner was spectiular with lots of snow even if a bit expensive at €35. The aire was just a car park but the town was quite nice and it only cost €3.</p>
