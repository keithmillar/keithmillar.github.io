<p>On the 5th October we flew to Alicante and collected a battered hire for the drive to Valencia, as one would expect the weather was fabulous. The drive was uneventfull and we arrived at John &amp; Mairead&rsquo;s house mid after noon, and it didn&rsquo;t take us long to get the wine on the go.</p>

<strong>Happy 50th Birthday Flo</strong></p>
<p>With glass in hand we enjoyed the weather for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>The next day we travelled into Valencia for some shopping and sight seeing. Many hours where spent wandering around the shops, and Flo bought a pair of cycling shoes.</p>
<p>A trip the station for some photos, and then the market for much needed Coffee and cake.</p>

<strong>Coffee &amp; Cake</strong></p>
<p>We enjoyed a lovely lunch in La Fonte a busy restaurent in Touris â‚¬7.50 for the menu del dia well worth it.</p>
<p>On Friday we drove back to Alicante and stayed in a Holiday Inn for our flight the next morning. That night we went to a new Japanese Buffet called the Wok, after a shakey start the meal turned out to be exclent with a hugh choice of food, so even cooked while you watched.</p>
