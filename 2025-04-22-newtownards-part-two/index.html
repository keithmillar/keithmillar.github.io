<p>Monday 14th April Karen was good enough to drop us of at
Enterprise to collect the hire van. Uneventful trip to Bangor with one stop for coffee and fuel</p>
<p>Tuesday 15th April Another skip was waiting in the driveway which we duly filled. Garage cleared as much as we can, this time and the van packed ready for Cork tomorrow. Dropped the canondale off at Michael&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Wednesday 16th April Made good time to Cork and where able to unpack the van at Karen&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Thursday 17th April Returned the hire van. Back at Karen&rsquo;s we moved stuff around in the garage and packed the car and trailer. We had time to rebuild the bead/sofa for Karen in the upstairs bedroom.</p>
<p>Friday 18th April calmer day spent some time on my PC looking at new blogging software. Also some shopping.</p>
<p>Saturday 19th April Miserable drive to Dublin rain all the way, made good time.</p>
<p>Sunday 20th April Late getting off the boat and nasty weather most of the way home. Bordeaux and San Sebastian the worst. Driving all in one go was too much especially with the poor weather. Trailer worked well and the tarp kept everything dry which was impressive considering the amount of rain.</p>
