<p>Last day and no Flo so Marty has free rain to do his worst, fortunately Marty was tired and I was able to keep up with out too much trouble, once again it was a good day cycling with a couple of big hills and two quick coffee stops.</p>
<p>We stayed close to the hotel tonight where we enjoyed  a good meal at a good price.</p>
<p>All in all it was a great trip the cycling was good especially once we got up into the hills and away from the tourist areas, the apartment was excellent and over all the food good and at the right price.
