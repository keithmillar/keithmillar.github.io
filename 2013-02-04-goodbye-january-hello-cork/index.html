<p>Finally January has given way to February and not soon enough as far as I am concerned, the weather has been appalling wet dull and cold and that was a good day, in fact it was the dullest Jan for 50yrs in some parts of the country.</p>
<p>{{ more }}</p>
<p>The drive down was not great due to heavy traffic, and a couple of accidents so it was 21:00 when we arrived starving but more of that later.</p>
<p>Saturday turned out to be a lovely bright cold day so after breakfast we went into Cork City for a look around and a nice coffee in insomnia. I treated myself to a travel coffee press.</p>
<p>Saturday evening and the real reason for our trip which was to attend a church service for Flo&rsquo;s father who died today five years a go. No one else appeared at the service so we went to the New Luyan on our own.</p>
<p>Cycling has been a real chore but things looked better on Sunday 3rd in Cork a mild if over cast day but dry no wind the best day in ages for a ride. I meet with John and some other guys from the Aquablue club and we rode to Bandon, Kinsale Carrigaline and back to Cork a nice run.</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon and we visited Patrick, Sarah and Nora.</p>
<p>Flo had arranged to meet up with John and Mairead in Barry&rsquo;s for dinner and a catch up, we had a nice meal and a chat, as usual solving the worlds problems.</p>
