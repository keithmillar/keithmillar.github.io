<p>A Foggy drive to Blacks Harbour and a longer Foggy boat ride to Grand Manan.</p>
<p>{{ more }}
After an early start we were all gasping for coffee when the boat docked we made a bee line for the first coffee shop we could find, the aromas when we opened the door where promising but we where told that this was a Roasting House and they couldn&rsquo;t sell coffee, so back on the road we went.</p>
<p>We ended up at the far end of the Island and no coffee, but it was decided we need a walk so a short very slippy walk was undertaken but was soon abandoned as it was too slippy under foot.</p>
<p>Driving back we stopped at Food for Thought for some very nice sandwiches although what we ordered and what we got where two different things.</p>
<p>We then explored some of the fascinating Light House and because the weather was so poor we changed to an earlier boat home.</p>
