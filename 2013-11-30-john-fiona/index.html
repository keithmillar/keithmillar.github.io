<p>Finally after much procrastinating we got round to having John and Fiona over for a meal.</p>
<p>{{ more }}</p>
<p>Flo worked hard to produce a great spread of food, which was devoured along with several bottles of wine.</p>
<p>It was nice to be able to return the compliment for the Christmas dinners we have enjoyed at their house.</p>
<p>It was good catching up and finding out what Mark and Lisa where doing, both seem well on the way to careers of their own.</p>
