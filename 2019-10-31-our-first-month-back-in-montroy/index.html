<p>Only here a few days barely settled in and it Flo&rsquo;s Birthday 59yrs. Went to the local Pizza place to celebrate Flo&rsquo;s big day and Amanda and Charlott joined us and supplied the Birthday Cake. The food was VG as always. .</p>
<p>The weather when we arrived was very hot 36c and has remained good all month with only one days rain and one day of thunder storms with not much rain.</p>
<p><strong>2019-10-16 Bugarra.</strong> We all went for a picnic by the river today. Watching the Fisher men with too much gear and no idea was very entertaining. Lotti had a ball even falling into the river.</p>
<p><strong>2019-10-18 Torrent Chinese.</strong> Amanda and Charlotte picked us up at 20:00 and we arrived first. The others arrived shortly after us. Roy and Paul where back until Christmas and the reason for tonight.</p>
<p>This was a Chinese buffet, except it wasn&rsquo;t a buffet. You ordered off a menu and your order is delivered to you in no particular order, the food was quite good, just a strange concept.</p>
<p><strong>2019-10-30 Finished Cycling Goal.</strong>
Yesterday I reached my Oct target of 900 miles, but as I have pushed my yearly target to 7000 mile I wanted to add a few more today. Unfortunately it was blowing a hooley this morning but I decided to give it a go any way, the worst bit was from Real towards Dos Aguas after I turned back towards Montserrat the wind was mainly a cross head wind until I reached Bunol and from there it was a strong tail wind home and gave me 958 miles for the month. Really please as the 7000 is now possible.</p>
