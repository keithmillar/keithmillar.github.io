<p>Didn&rsquo;t get this month off to a good start, Flo was due back form Italy with her Mother on Saturday so I Drove down to Dublin to pick them up and then continued on to Cork.</p>
<p>{{ more }}</p>
<p>All went well until I went to bed on Saturday night and I managed to catch my little toe on Lotti&rsquo;s stool, sore wouldn&rsquo;t even start to describe what I felt. A trip to Ards Casualty on the way home confirmed a broken toe.</p>
<p>As this was Flo&rsquo;s last month working for RSA it was mainly taken up getting the Car ready, fitting a tow bar, wiring tow bar and fixing the heater. Also Ronda was due MOT so checked her over and luckily she went through without a Problem.</p>
<p>After about 10 days off the bike I was able to ride again with out too much pain. Later in the month Marty and I got 100 miler in around the Mournes.</p>
<p>The Coastal Challenge was the next event on the calendar and for the first time we sold out 1000 places before the closing date after a slow start. The day passed without incident, and possibly the best weather in several years.</p>
<p>The rest of our time was taken up getting ready for Flo&rsquo;s impending retirement, paying off our loans and most importantly the Mortgage.</p>
<p>When the day finally came we went to Roma&rsquo;s for a few drinks and a nice meal. This brought to end the 90 day notice period which seemed to drag along at an unbelievably slow pace.</p>
