<p>We decided to concentrate on the Kitchen Garden and we are halfway through filling our 3rd skip, but we had to take a break bolloxed, 23c and heavy work but the end is near, and the garden is clear of all rubbish.</p>

<p>Some light weeding turned into an epic root removal session, but it was worth the effort as Raffa came round with his ancient Rotavator and made our garden workable. We acquired Seed potatoes which we have planted and small selection of veg to be planted tomorrow.</p>
<p>Flo found a place selling pre used depositos. Off we went with our new trailer and collected a 1000 ltr cube which after much digging and rock smashing we got into position, low enough to allow water to drain from the house grey water waste. I tested with two washes and the pipe work did it&rsquo;s job, waste going straight into the settlement cube. The issue now is in order to water the garden a second cube is required placed higher so that gravity can work its magic. Off we went and acquired a second cube, and a pump from Autosolar, I then pumped the water from the lower cube through a water filter into the distribution cube.</p>

<p>Gonzalo in Real supplied all we need for irrigation system , and a few adjustment on the advice of Pepe and we are up and running.</p>
<p>A trip to Ikea to collect the final kitchen cupboard still no door.</p>
