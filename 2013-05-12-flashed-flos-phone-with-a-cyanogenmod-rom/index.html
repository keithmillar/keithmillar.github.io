<p>After a huge amount of fannying around Flo finally decided to to install a new rom on her HTC Wildfire, we followed the Instructions on this web site <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wiki.cyanogenmod.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and everything went fairly smoothly. The main reason she wanted to do this was the orignal rom was full of google apps which she didn&rsquo;t use, and the phone was running out of space so she could not install Facebook, and google refuse to allow you to remove their apps. (gmail, google maps, adobe reader and the HTC sence)</p>
<p>After the new rom was install we where able to load Facebook no problem, so just a matter of reinstalling her prefered apps and customising the phone to her taste.</p>
<p>One thing to rember was the SD card was not touched during the upgrade.</p>
<p>Will I do mine now?</p>
