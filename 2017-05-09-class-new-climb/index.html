<!--start excerpt-->
<p>Found this road (vp-5051) last week after passing it quite a few times in the past, I new it was there I just didn&rsquo;t know if it could be made part of a run.</p>
<p>{{ more }}</p>
<p>Looking at the map I realised it joined back onto the cv-580 Dos Aguas Alborache Rd , so I decided to give it a go.</p>
<p>A slightly narrow road but superb surface and views to die for. After descending the only thing to do is climb it.</p>
<p>Today was as good a day as any so off I set once I turned on to the climb it didn&rsquo;t disappoint in fact it turned out to be easier than I expected although I may of had some wind assistance. Apart from one car I was on my own the views were just what I expected.</p>
