<p>Back to Victoria Crescent once again this time on my own. Flew into Cork and Karen collected me at the airport. Next day I collected a van and drove up Newtownards.</p>
<p>Made good time so I checked into the hotel, once this was done I drove over to the house where I proceeded to load the van with the last things we wanted and did a tidy up inside and out,this took less time than anticipated, rang May and she was free I called with her and enjoyed an evening catching up.</p>
<p>Thursday and my eye test was cancelled, rang Marty but he was away, nothing else for headed back to Cork taking my time, once Karen arrive back I unloaded the van.</p>
<p>Friday I returned the van and spent a morning around Cork still thriving although quite this morning. Back at Karen&rsquo;s I sorted the boxes for Spain and when Judy arrived home we all went out for a pint.</p>
<p>Saturday Karen and I went for a coffee in Kinsale then she dropped me at the airport.</p>
<p>House is now on the market.</p>
