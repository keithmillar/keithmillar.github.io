We arrive at Urrugne around 14:30 and quickly found the camp-site after a long but enjoyable drive. This was by far the nicest day so far with the temperature rising all the way here.

<p>The camp-site was <a href="http://www.larrouleta.com">Camping Larrouleta</a> a nice site with good facilities would recommend and use again.
