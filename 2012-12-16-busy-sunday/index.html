<p>Started off the day in the garden raking up leaves, and then we cut back the honeysuckle and found a fancy mushroom growing under the bush.</p>
<p>I have been hearing a strange noise from kzone, so I finally ran smartctl on it and to my horror discovered that all the drives where showing errors. I decided to replace the drive containing the OS straight away, which ment a trip to PC World for a new WD 500GB HD but coffee in Castle Espie was more inportant and being Sunday the shops hadn&rsquo;t yet opened.</p>
<p>{{ more }}</p>
<p>After coffee first stop was PC World then Bloomfield which was packed, Flo did her thing and we got OTF and back home. First thing I did when I got home was to order a second HD to replace the other 3 dodgy dics.</p>
<p>I used Clonezilla to clone the new disc and installed it straight away, kzone booted up no problem. Then it dawned on me that I was not using all the new drive as it was twice the size of the old one, so I downloaded the live version of gparted and booted it deleted the swap space and resized the root partition and recreated the swap space, rebooted and all good.</p>
<p>Finaly sitting down and watching crap on the TV</p>
