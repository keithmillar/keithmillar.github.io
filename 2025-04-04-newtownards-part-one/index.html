<p>With only a few day&rsquo;s between Garth and Helena leaving we were running against the clock to get ready for our trip to Newtownards and Cork.</p>

<p>Got a phone call on Monday that our trailer tarp was ready to collect. It fits perfectly.</p>
<p>Dropping Woody off on our way and making our first stop Pau eased the journey significantly, an early start on Saturday ment we cleared Bordeaux with little trafik and made good time to Saint Lo. We also enjoyed suburb weather all the way. Sunday we only needed to do 100k to get to Cherbourg. Wanting fuel and coffee Valonges fitted the bill, found a great bakery which supplied cake and coffee. Thirty minute drive and we where at the boat. A smooth crossing and 11:00 we started on our way to Newtownards.</p>
<p>We checked into the Premiere Inn and readied ourselves for Tuesday. Arriving in Ards and a skip was waiting for us, nothing to do but start filling it. Flo took loads to local charity shops and the guy from restore took furniture.</p>
<p>Wednesday was much the same and when the skip was filled, we packed the car and trailer. Back to the Premiere Inn for a shower the Marty and Pam&rsquo;s for tea and a chat.</p>
<p>Flo arranged to meet with some friends in Jenny Watts, a couple of pints and it was like we never left.  I sold the Black Canondale to Michael Hamilton.</p>
<p>Early start Thursday stopping off for Jakes Confirmation and on to Cork arriving at Karen&rsquo;s 21:00</p>
<p>Friday we unloaded the Car and trailer into Karen&rsquo;s garage and did a quick sort of stuff.</p>
<p>Saturday we went to Patrick and Sarah&rsquo;s for lunch and also we dit some shopping in and around Douglas.</p>
