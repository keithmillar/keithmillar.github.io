<p>Garth and Helena treated Flo and I to three nights in the Medium Hotel Valencia.
We he had a couple of days to explore round Valencia and go to the Marathon Expo which was much better than last year.
On Friday once finish with Garth and Helena, Flo and I took the tram back in to the city were we found a fab little bar which also sold Vinyl LP&rsquo;s and CD&rsquo;s with music posters adorning the walls a good find.
Saturday was the Bimbo run which we Half heartily took part in and once it was finished we headed for breakfast in the hotel then home.</p>
