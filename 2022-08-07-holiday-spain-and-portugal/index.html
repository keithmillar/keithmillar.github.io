<p><strong>Seville</strong></p>
<p>Set off nice and early Friday 29th July and arrived around 17:00: Settled into the Hotel and wandered round some of Seville. The Plaza de España in the park Parque de María Luisa was stunning a worth a vist even better it was right beside the hotel. We continued on and found a bar for some well needed refreshment Temp was 40c</p>

<p>After a Leisurely breakfast we cycled around The city, a bit of a shaky start but once we got going it was pretty good, along the river bank all on bike lanes - We Came to a park which was lovely at and better still there was a bar coke was the order and did the job. Now heading back towards the city we passed the Pabellon de Navegación an exhibition and trade center. We then continued to the city center for lunch and look at the Metropol Parasol a  wooden like structure erected in 2011. After a siesta we walked in to the city proper and found some interesting restaurants, and after an icecream we went back to the hotel bar where I had my first Bloody Mary.</p>

<p><strong>Portugal</strong></p>
<p>From Seville we continued on to Portugal and Alvor, once checked into the hotel we cycled to Michaels apartment where we meet with all the McCosh and Perrys. The next few days fell into a similar patten with Flo and I doing our thing during the day then meeting up with every one at night for food &amp; drink. We enjoy company of both families and as normal the crack was great and all the children where exemplary. Flo and I did some walking. One walk on the Board walk went down the coast by the beach, was good giving some excellent views of the town. Next day we found a nice walk out of the town along the Torre River towards the air port. On our final day Michael and Colin collected us for a look at the Portimão Race Circuit. Well impressed quite a venue.</p>

<p>A nice drive through Portugal to a well kept city original streets all cobbles and the Roman Temple of Evora also known as the Temple of Diana.</p>

<p><strong>Merida</strong></p>
<p>Merida another city influenced by the Romans. A Roman built bridge leads into the old city, where we found a bar for Tapa&rsquo;s and Beer food was very good and the beer went down all too easly. The hotel was a bit odd, newish building but in an old style.</p>

<p><strong>Toledo</strong></p>
<p>Toledo a walled city, on a hill above the plain of Castilla-La Mancha it&rsquo;s the capital of the region. Once checked in we walked in to the old city center to find something to eat eventually we found a square with Tapa&rsquo;s bars, once we ate and wandered back to the hotel to get some respite form the heat 40c at night. Sat and Flo found a cycle around the outskirts of the city. A bit hilly for our folding bikes but worth it for the city views, much better to look at Toledo from the outside very impressive. Anyway back to the hotel a rest and out to the nearest bar which was in the park Parque del Crucero a good spot- used by the locals.</p>
