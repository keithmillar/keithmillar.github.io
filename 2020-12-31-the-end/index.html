<p>Disappointed not to get a last cycle in but the wind has been relentless all month, so I settled on a walk with Flo and the girls over in Montserrat. Then we lunched in the town.</p>
<p>Flo and I saw in the New Year at home with the fire blazing.</p>
<p>For many this has been a very poor year, for us it was more of an inconvenience. We managed to buy a House make it habitable, buy a car, and take up residence in Spain. Most of this was made possible by Flo&rsquo;s love of paper work and her grasp of the Language and willingness to dive in and sort things out.</p>
