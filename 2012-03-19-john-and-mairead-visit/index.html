<p>St Patricks was on Sat so as it is a holiday down south John and Mairea where able to come up for the weekend. John and I managed to get out on our bikes every day as the weather was unseasonably good mild and dry.</p>
<p>On sat we rode the club run to Portaferry, I was caught short and stopped but I was unable to catch the group, luckily they stopped for coffee and I was able to join them for the rest of the ride.</p>
<p>Saturday evening and we went to Romas for a meal and a few pints lovely meal and good company what more do you need.</p>
<p>Sunday morning and we all headed out on our bikes, with John and I meeting Flo and Mairead in Mountsteward and all coming back to ards with the Club.</p>
<p>With the weather staying good John and myself went off on a hilly ride to Carryduf, Saintfield, Shrigley and  Whitrock stopping for coffee in Daft Eddys with the two girls then back to Ards</p>
