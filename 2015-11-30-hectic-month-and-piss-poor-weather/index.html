<p>This turned out to be a totally manic month, having committed ourselves to Spain on the 13th of December and a stressful visit to Cork on the 17th, with the van not even half finished it was all hands on deck.</p>
<p>Lots of internet searching and Flo found a guy down south selling a Waco Fridge and a cooker, naturally that was too simple, and to avoid p+p we decided to meet him in Newry on the 10th and pick them up.</p>
<p>Finished all the insulation and fitted the N/S ply panel which was very fiddly but seems a good job. Bought a cheap hole cutter for the light fittings, this was a big mistake ended up returning it and buying a Bosh one which was 100 times better, finally got the holes for the lights cut and the panels lined lights fitted and wired up.</p>
<p>Cut the floor and the packing for between the strengtheners glued them in place and fitted the floor which turned out to be a bit of a bastard.</p>
<p>All the electric switches etc. arrived. I installed the 240 hookup, ran the cable and some flexible conduit and  started fitting the curtain rails and curtains with these installed things finally started coming together.</p>
<p>Next the Battery/Seat unit and the bed frame.</p>
<p>Then we travelled in Blu to Cork our first long run in her all good. Made final arrangements with John and Maread for the house in Spain, and met with Karen at Blackrock Castle.</p>
<p>Finished the Battery/Seat unit mounted Sterling charger, fuse box and Consumer unit. All cables in place and soldered the power cable for Leisure Battery. Temp installed seat unit and connected all wiring after a problem with the sterling charger every thing worked.</p>
<p>The piss poor weather is killing us for getting the floor cut and laid.
