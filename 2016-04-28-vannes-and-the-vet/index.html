<p>Both Flo and I spent the night running to the toilet luckily we where parked right beside the toilets and they where heated.</p>
<p>{{ more }}
Feeling a bit off we all set off to the vet, a bit different from home only one vet no receptionist, anyway all went well and Lotti can now travel.</p>
<p>From the vet we walked in the center of Vannes turns out it is quite a big town, with an older pedestrian part and a more modern but much busier area. Wwe grabbed a bag of chips down at the harbour before doing the town then a coffee before we headed back to Blu, the walk back was nice and we stopped and watched while a boat was moved in the boat yard.</p>
<p>The campsite had a nice restaurant which we made good use of as we where starting to feel a good bit better.</p>
