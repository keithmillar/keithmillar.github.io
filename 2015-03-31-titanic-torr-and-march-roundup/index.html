First nice day for a long time so we took Lotti to Ballywalter for a swim. Must be a year since we where last here.

<p>After much deliberation Marty and I entered the Titanic Torr, having a good idea that we would do this ride I had done some good long rides, 90 plus miles so I was confident of doing the distance.</p>
<p>On The day the weather could not have been better light Northerly wind and clear blue skies, the route was good with many new roads especially at the start. All in all in was quite an uneventful event with quite roads.</p>
<p>Once we got to the hilly parts of the course the group soon split with two guys joining Marty and myself (Andrew Evans Killinchy and Ronnie Massey Banbridge) we where all pretty evenly matched. Stopped for a quick coffee in Cushendun and we soon on our way again, temp start to drop but we made it back before dark home for 18:00</p>
<p>Received all the parts for my wheel build, so got stuck in and got them build after getting stuck with the rear lacing all good now just to test them.</p>
<p>The test did not go too well front wheel lost all tension, had to get Flo to rescue me. Think I was too conservative with the spoke tension all seem well now after a rebuild.</p>
