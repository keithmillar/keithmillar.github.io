<p>Garth and Helena having left on the 17th March and arrived safely back in Canada, now face 14 days self quarantine, very disappointing to miss out on their company. This has left Flo and I not quite knowing what to do, or what the coming days will bring.</p>
<p>On the 20th we decided to see how the land lay and went to the Charter. All very orderly, limited entry to the store on a one in one out bases, and the ever present scrutiny from the Local Police and even a visit from the Guarda Civil.</p>
<p>Into our second week of the Coronavirus lock down and the miserable weather has helped to ease us into the State of Emergency. Spent the week in the house until Friday when Flo ventured to the Charter for some shopping. The weather was dire, so no cue and very few people which was good in and out in a flash and little or no contact with anyone.</p>
<p>Hearing that the State of Emergency will be extended until 25th April at the earliest</p>
<p>The weather has been dire cold and long periods of rain some very heavy, all this means the ground is soft and sticky which makes it nearly impossible to walk on it. The garden is now so over grown we can&rsquo;t access most of it. Waiting for cable to be delivered for the Weed Wacker, and dry weather to be able to get in to the garden and cut it back.</p>
<p>Managed Breakfast outside today (8th) for first time in quite a while a bit of heat goes a long way enen if it is short lived.</p>
<p>I have endured a nasty headache the last couple of days, felt better today headache mostly gone. So I Cleaned out the sealant from my rear wheel and it was a real mess, remount the tyre only to find it&rsquo;s punctured looking at YouTube looks like the best thing is too patch the inside of the tyre, which didn&rsquo;t really work I remounted the tyre and left it until I need it and then I will add sealant.</p>
<p>15th Another stinking wet day took Eddy out to get heavy things such as water, wine and food for Maxi, on the way back from the Mercadona there was no body about so stopped in Montroy and filled up with more water and called into the Charter for choclate, in all a successful trip our first together since Garth and Helena arrived back on the 10th March.</p>
<p>Strimmer Cable Arrived, never so excited to be able to cut back the weeds. Friday (17th) started on the garden and finished Saturday Garden Strimmed and path cleared all the way around the house for walking/running.</p>
<p>Lock down extent until 9th May but children under 14 allowed out for 1hr a day with parent, hopefully this weekend will see the easing of some restrictions, would be great to get out for a walk or even a cycle.</p>
<p>At long last the weather has improved and the ground has dried to allow walking without carrying loads of mud on ones feet. The hardest thing is lack of motivation the better weather helps but it&rsquo;s difficult when you see your weight climbing it would be very easy to say fuck it and do nothing. April is almost over Easter been and gone and all we have done is mark time, and we are not on our own, many worse off than we are, with no space to exercise, as they live in apartments, lots with children, the stress must be immense. With a bit of luck next month might bring an improvement world wide and we can get back to some normality.</p>
