<p>Cleaned the Kitchen today, all the units on the outside,then the floor and cooker. Saved the inside of the cupboards for another day. Managed to break the light under the cupboard.</p>
<p>Then I spent the afternoon trying to copy Helena&rsquo;s emails etc from Outlook, waiting for the outlook.ost file to download to see if it will run on my computer.</p>
<p>Once again the club email is screwing with me, changed the email from address to fausto and all hell broke loose, sorted with flo&rsquo;s help then the mail was unreadable in fastmail, not sure if this was just a glitch in the space time continuum or or the character encoding was wrong so I altered the encoding.</p>
