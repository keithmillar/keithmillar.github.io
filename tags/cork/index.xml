      <description>Not much blogging this month so this is just a catchup.
{{ more }} Sat 4th and we meat up with the Perry&amp;rsquo;s and McCosh&amp;rsquo;s (No Children) in the Lewis Dundonald. We had been warned that there was a Loyalist Disco on at 21:00 but we where not told that as a precursor they where having a band competition so towards the end of our meal two Bands struck up a deafening racket in the small bar, sad to see that not much has really changed in the North, however the food was very good and as is to be expected the crac was mighty, we finished off the evening back at Colin and Beverly&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Flo and I went to the vets Lunch in the Esplanade, this was the first time Flo had been to one of these and I several years since I had been to one. Turned out not too bad food was good but as usual service was slow. This year the Club had laid on a comedian, heard worse. {{ more }}
On Friday the 9th we headed down to Cork, via a visit to Trish.</description>
