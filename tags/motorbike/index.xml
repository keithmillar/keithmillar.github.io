Requena for the Flat track which I heard about from Denis Noyes in the USA. A pretty low key meeting with none of the named riders turning up great track but poor racing on a bitterly cold windy day. It had rained over night which made the track very slippery until it started to dry.I reckon the guys from home would have cleaned up.</description>
