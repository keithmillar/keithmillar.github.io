      <title>Portable Emacs </title>

      <description>While reading gmane.emacs.help I came accross this post where somebody asked how he could make a portable app out of Emacs&amp;rsquo; Windows version.
So since I&amp;rsquo;m still at my internship (where they use Windows) and just recently obtained an iAudio X5L portable media player which behaves like an USB2 harddisk to the OS I wondered if I could manage to make Emacs portable.
Short version: I could, the &amp;ldquo;hardest&amp;rdquo; part was in fact not even Emacs related, but my sheer lack of knowledge about Windows batch script.</description>

      <description>Started to get a feel for emacs to day, and it did take nearly all day. Finding information is not a problem finding current and relevant info can be a real challenge. How ever I did get the colour theme working and formatted the date in the calendar for European formatting. I even added the Moto GP and World Super Bike dates. Now all I have to do is put it all all together and start org mode.</description>
