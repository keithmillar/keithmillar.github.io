      <description>We meet up with Karen and Lola at Blackrock Castle for a walk, bitterly cold today especially after the mild days we have gotten used to. The only place open for coffee was the Natural Food Bakery and it was doing a roaring trade and we where lucky to get a table outside with the dogs.

      <description>Leaving for the Causeway the weather looked a bit dodgy, but quite mild at 16c for the time of year, and the closer we got to Ballintoy the poorer it became to the point it was raining slightly. However as we arrived in Ballintoy the sky started to clear and the sun threatened to shine. While Flo drove to the Giants Causeway and parked Blu, then got the bus back Lotti and I walked down to the Carrick-a-Rede bridge and enjoyed a Coffee in the sun outside the gift shop, watching tourists running from there tour buses to the rope bridge.</description>

      <description>Piss poor morning but the weather forecast said it would improve. Looking from our bedroom window I could see Donard, so we took a punt and off we went.
{{ more }}
Caught the Bus to Bloody Bridge (£2.00pp one way) and started walking, this time we found the easier path to the Quarry, once at the Quarry the going get slightly harder under foot until you reach the wall. Once at the wall the hard stuff begins this time I crossed the wall as under foot it was much better, nearing the top the wall has collapsed and boulders are strewn across the mountain so I crossed back over the wall and continued to the summit, to be joined by Flo about 30 mins later.</description>

As prep for Garths party in Sept we walked the black route around Tollymore not a great walk, not much too see and loads of trees have been cut down, never the less a good backup walk in case of bad weather. {{ more }}</description>

      <description>Last day of the Medieval Market in Llombai today and as I had walked or cycled for the past 3 days we agreed to give it a visit and have an easy day. “Mercado Renacentista de los Borja de Llombai”. Used google translate to try to make sense of this info. supplied by Yelp …

      <description>Return and did this trail correctly – SL-CV 13 from Alborache. It was well worth it – caves were fabulous and Lotti even got a swim. This was after we had disturbed a large owl from its nest – flew out as we arrived, enormous ! {{ more }}</description>

      <description>Karen&amp;rsquo;s annual trip coincided with some nice weather so we went to Castle Ward. {{ more }}
It was convenient that this was also one of the walks we had to do for Garth&amp;rsquo;s walking tour next September. The place was jumping as there was a Family Fun Day for Halloween.
For Garth&amp;rsquo;s Tour I think we should walk in the other direction.</description>

It was a nice surprise to find an Autotest taking place, well it&amp;rsquo;s been many years since I have spectated at one of these and it brought back many memories of when Chris Jackie and myself went to these and other motoring events</description>

&lt;p&gt;Tropical temperatures once again today 22c can&amp;rsquo;t believe it at this time of year. A furley steep start the walk but once we reached the cliff edge the walking was much easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We decided to go for a walk today, and after great debate I decided on Murlough Bay just outside Dundrum. So off we set just after 10:00 rather later than I would have like, but that&amp;rsquo;s the price of indecision. Arrived in the car park just before 11:00 and off we set.
Murloch
Well what a surprise as we set off through the sand dunes, a board walk lead us to the beach, and fantastic views of the Mourne Mountains towering over Newcastle.</description>
