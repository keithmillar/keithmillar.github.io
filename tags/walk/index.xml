      <description>&lt;p&gt;Took Lotti to the river in Bugarra for a walk and hopefully a swim.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Karen&amp;rsquo;s annual trip coincided with some nice weather so we went to Castle Ward. {{ more }}
It was convenient that this was also one of the walks we had to do for Garth&amp;rsquo;s walking tour next September. The place was jumping as there was a Family Fun Day for Halloween.
For Garth&amp;rsquo;s Tour I think we should walk in the other direction.</description>

Great walk from the Giants Causeway to Carrick-a-rede with Action Cancer, bus collected us from Carrick-a-rede and dropped us off at the Giants Causeway, we the walked back along the Cliff tops and down to the beach and finally back to Carrick-a-rede. Great weather as well, cool and sunny with a very strong wind.</description>

      <description>Belfast Hills Partnership walk got off to a slow start but once it got going it was quit good. Our Guide Cormac Hamall of the Cave Hill Conservation group was very knowledgeable and quite interesting.
I found a Six Spotted Burnett Moth. {{ more }}</description>

      <description>Too foggy to Cycle so we all went for a walk, turned out to be really bright and sunny on the Coastal Path unlike the damp foggy Ards. {{ more }}

      <description>We decided to go for a walk today, and after great debate I decided on Murlough Bay just outside Dundrum. So off we set just after 10:00 rather later than I would have like, but that&amp;rsquo;s the price of indecision. Arrived in the car park just before 11:00 and off we set.
Murloch
Well what a surprise as we set off through the sand dunes, a board walk lead us to the beach, and fantastic views of the Mourne Mountains towering over Newcastle.</description>
