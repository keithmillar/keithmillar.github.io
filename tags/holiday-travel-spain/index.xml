Flo Cycle today with coffee in Alborache, quite hilly again with longish drags and a nasty little bit around Bunyol, left too late and once again very hot, but the road surfaces are second to none if only they where like this at home. Altury , LLombai, Real, Montroy, Monserrat, Godelleta, Bunyol, Alborache, Turis and Altury.
Around 21:00 we went into Turis for the last night of the Jazz in the Amfiteatre, tonight it was a local school with their teachers.</description>

      <description>{{ more }} We left Altury around 10:00 and arrived in Albarcete about 13:00, we took a longer route but it was worth it as the scenery was lovely and once again the roads dead quite.
We drove into the centre of Albarcete and parked in an underground car park about 500mts from the stage finish.
After getting orientated we bought some Vuelta goodies and went to get something to eat in a nearby bar, we took up position on the 50 meter line and watched the race unfold on the big screen while collecting loads of pruck from the publicity caravan.</description>

      <description>After much messing around and the use of a translator we could only get an 10m Allen key and no bearings. We rang John back in Cork to see if he could get bearings brought by one of his fiends. However when I got home and removed the cranks the bearing where fine. so I rebuild and the noise was gone. {{ more }}
I went for a test ride and the bike was fine, no creaking, but I have never experienced wind like it unbelievably hot very strange for me.</description>
