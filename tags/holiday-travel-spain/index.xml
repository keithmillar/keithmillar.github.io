Last time we came here it was very busy with fishermen all around the Lough shore, this time there where 3 fishermen, which for all intents and purposes we had the whole Lough to ourselves.
We soon discovered that we could not walk all the way around going anticlockwise, so doubled back on ourselves and went clockwise, and where able to walk all of the west side and on to the lane to the road.</description>

      <description>Last day of our holidays so I added a couple of loops together and ended up with a decent run once again it was very warm and sunny.
{{ more }} My bottom bracket started making noise again so new bearings needed on return home. A quick shower and I started packing up BC for the return home.

      <description>Out for a spin with Flo again today. Trying to find the road from Turis to Chiva was like looking for a needle in a haystack, finaly Flo found it and we had shorter reverse of Sundays run, with Coffee in Monserrat. {{ more }} Spent the evening watching a distant thunder storm from the pool, no sound just the light show. Today&amp;rsquo;s route was Altury, Turis, Godelleta, Monserrat, Montroy, Real and Turis.</description>

      <description>I should have been here!
{{ more }} Brilliant road from Dos Aguas to Bicor, first part through a deep river valley including a nice 2+ mile descent then a load of climbing until the descent into Bicor, from here to Sumacarrer was pretty up and down. The plan was to meet Flo here and cycle on through Tous and back to Altury but there was no way from Tous to Sumacarrcer by this time I was very hot so we decided to call it a day and I came home with Flo in the car.</description>

Flo Cycle today with coffee in Alborache, quite hilly again with longish drags and a nasty little bit around Bunyol, left too late and once again very hot, but the road surfaces are second to none if only they where like this at home. Altury , LLombai, Real, Montroy, Monserrat, Godelleta, Bunyol, Alborache, Turis and Altury.
Around 21:00 we went into Turis for the last night of the Jazz in the Amfiteatre, tonight it was a local school with their teachers.</description>

      <description>{{ more }} We left Altury around 10:00 and arrived in Albarcete about 13:00, we took a longer route but it was worth it as the scenery was lovely and once again the roads dead quite.
We drove into the centre of Albarcete and parked in an underground car park about 500mts from the stage finish.
After getting orientated we bought some Vuelta goodies and went to get something to eat in a nearby bar, we took up position on the 50 meter line and watched the race unfold on the big screen while collecting loads of pruck from the publicity caravan.</description>

      <description>After much messing around and the use of a translator we could only get an 10m Allen key and no bearings. We rang John back in Cork to see if he could get bearings brought by one of his fiends. However when I got home and removed the cranks the bearing where fine. so I rebuild and the noise was gone. {{ more }}
I went for a test ride and the bike was fine, no creaking, but I have never experienced wind like it unbelievably hot very strange for me.</description>
