      <description>&lt;p&gt;After charging our old lead acid batteries, I rebooted the inverter only for it to fail, so no electricity. Mario was good enough to come over after work and told us the bad news, we need a new inverter €1500.00 later and an inverter was ordered.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/2024/2024-01-31-new-month-new-year-new-problems-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;New Panels in situ&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Panels in situ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a very hot spell, even cycling early morning is a struggle. Not done much did fit the bike room window just before the heat got going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning 27th we got a big thunder storm which cleared the air and temps finally dropped and it remained very windy all day and into Monday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During or recent trip to Madrid we passed this shop selling all types of springs, later the same day we found a shop for leather workers selling everything from hide to tiny grommets, pliers, cutters and punches the list goes on. On our last day I found an arcade with 6 to 8 clock / watch shops again selling everything from watches , batteries, faces, glass iand tools to fit glass and many thing I could not identify. Never seen the like back home, looks to me like the Spanish repair stuff. Even back in Real it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get parts for things, we could learn from this back home.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/2023/2023-01-31-repair-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Spring Shop&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spring Shop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well December arrived rather quickly, one minute the year was ticking along and the next thing Fo was talking Christmas. I think this was partly due to Flo going home at the start of the month to catchup with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/2023/2022-12-30-christmas-dog-sitters-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Flo overlooking the Caves&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flo overlooking the Caves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A bit windy today but decided to take the plunge and brave the C-12 to Flix wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad.&#xA;Our First Passage On A Barca&#xA;{{ more }}&#xA;I decided on a short run due to the wind and not knowing the roads , fairly easy spin with some very poor road surface, which was made up for by a newly resurfaced section on a fast twisty decent.&#xA;On a whim I turned on to the back road into Flix and at the top of a steep hill found Flo photographing a sign, we both continued on to Flix only to find our route blocked by the river, luckily for us there was a free ferry across the river although it was one of the strangest I have come across.</description>

One stop was a place called Alacon an old fortified town over looking a river and Dam, our first coffe and cake of the trip the next stop was in a service station which was also very good with a great hunting shop.</description>

      <description>{{ more }} We left Altury around 10:00 and arrived in Albarcete about 13:00, we took a longer route but it was worth it as the scenery was lovely and once again the roads dead quite.&#xA;We drove into the centre of Albarcete and parked in an underground car park about 500mts from the stage finish.&#xA;After getting orientated we bought some Vuelta goodies and went to get something to eat in a nearby bar, we took up position on the 50 meter line and watched the race unfold on the big screen while collecting loads of pruck from the publicity caravan.</description>
