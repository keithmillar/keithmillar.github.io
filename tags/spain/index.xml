This turned out to be a lovely road climbing for 14km not too steep and ending with a great open descent into Segorbe, well worth revisiting for a cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A bit windy today but decided to take the plunge and brave the C-12 to Flix wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad.
Our First Passage On A Barca
{{ more }}
I decided on a short run due to the wind and not knowing the roads , fairly easy spin with some very poor road surface, which was made up for by a newly resurfaced section on a fast twisty decent.
On a whim I turned on to the back road into Flix and at the top of a steep hill found Flo photographing a sign, we both continued on to Flix only to find our route blocked by the river, luckily for us there was a free ferry across the river although it was one of the strangest I have come across.</description>

      <description>We decided to have Easter here in Turis and travel to Cordoba on Easter Monday, when most of the Spanish traffic is heading home from Hols. This turned out to be a good decision as the volume of traffic on the other carriage way was considerable. We also had two good coffee stops which eased the trip. One stop was a place called Alacon an old fortified town over looking a river and Dam, our first coffe and cake of the trip the next stop was in a service station which was also very good with a great hunting shop.</description>

She then looked for walks on Wikiloc and found this one, sl-13. It was about 10km and very steep at the start with fabulous views, the decent was very narrow and steep one place even had a hand rail. </description>

      <description>We left Aubeterre-sur-Dronne around 09:30 after coffee and a bun a lovely bright morning for a change but much colder.
{{ more }} We arrive at Urrugne around 14:30 and quickly found the camp-site after a long but enjoyable drive. This was by far the nicest day so far with the temperature rising all the way here. Once we got settled in I showered and shaved, then we took Lotti for a walk and looked for somewhere to eat no luck in that department so we drove up to the nearest super market bought some food and enjoyed our first outdoor meal.</description>

      <description>Out for a spin with Flo again today. Trying to find the road from Turis to Chiva was like looking for a needle in a haystack, finaly Flo found it and we had shorter reverse of Sundays run, with Coffee in Monserrat.
Spent the evening watching a distant thunder storm from the pool, no sound just the light show. Today&amp;rsquo;s route was Altury, Turis, Godelleta, Monserrat, Montroy, Real and Turis.</description>

      <description>{{ more }} We left Altury around 10:00 and arrived in Albarcete about 13:00, we took a longer route but it was worth it as the scenery was lovely and once again the roads dead quite.
We drove into the centre of Albarcete and parked in an underground car park about 500mts from the stage finish.
After getting orientated we bought some Vuelta goodies and went to get something to eat in a nearby bar, we took up position on the 50 meter line and watched the race unfold on the big screen while collecting loads of pruck from the publicity caravan.</description>

We rang John back in Cork to see if he could get bearings brought by one of his fiends. However when I got home and removed the cranks the bearing where fine. so I rebuild and the noise was gone. {{ more }}
I went for a test ride and the bike was fine, no creaking, but I have never experienced wind like it unbelievably hot very strange for me.</description>
