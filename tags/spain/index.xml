      <description>Still afloat and the weather looks crap, grey and wet.

Arrived in Rosslare and after a short spell in the house we went to Kilmore Quay for Fish &amp;amp; Chips</description>

      <description>Very cold last night with some heavy rain, fortunately it dried up for breakfast but it was only about 6c, on the road nice and early with our first stop Mont St Michel forecast not great but fingers crossed.
{{ more }} Mont st Michel is obviously a massive tourist attraction the car park alone is ginormous. Once parked it was nice to discover the cost also included return transport along the elevated causeway.</description>

      <description>Both Flo and I spent the night running to the toilet luckily we where parked right beside the toilets and they where heated.
{{ more }} Feeling a bit off we all set off to the vet, a bit different from home only one vet no receptionist, anyway all went well and Lotti can now travel.
From the vet we walked in the center of Vannes turns out it is quite a big town, with an older pedestrian part and a more modern but much busier area.</description>

      <description>Up early this morning and on the road straight after breakfast, a bit damp so no point in hanging around. Heavy rain and heavy traffic so we diverted off the main road and took a slightly longer route but much nicer arrived in Chinon 18:30. {{ more }} Usual routine find optimum place for Blu then into Chinon for a quick look and something to eat. Found a nice Restaurant which accepted Lotti and we enjoyed a lovely meal and 1&amp;frasl;2 bottle of wine.</description>

      <description>A quick stop in Empuriabrava to suss out Flo&amp;rsquo;s Brothers Spanish bolt hole, nice spot very built up hectic in high season. Arrived in Carcassone around lunchtime, and being in France parking was piss easy and close to the Old Town.
{{ more }} We walked around the Medevile town just what you would expect narrow streets and lots of shops although many where local crafts.
Then we followed the walking trail into the modern town and this was also very nice with a canal running through it, in the square we grabbed a spot of lunch and the back to Blu to contine on to Castres.</description>

      <guid>https://keithmillar.github.io/2016-04-02-easter-tour/</guid>
      <description>We decided to have Easter here in Turis and travel to Cordoba on Easter Monday, when most of the Spanish traffic is heading home from Hols. This turned out to be a good decision as the volume of traffic on the other carriage way was considerable. We also had two good coffee stops which eased the trip. One stop was a place called Alacon an old fortified town over looking a river and Dam, our first coffe and cake of the trip the next stop was in a service station which was also very good with a great hunting shop.</description>

{{ more }} We arrive at Urrugne around 14:30 and quickly found the camp-site after a long but enjoyable drive. This was by far the nicest day so far with the temperature rising all the way here. Once we got settled in I showered and shaved, then we took Lotti for a walk and looked for somewhere to eat no luck in that department so we drove up to the nearest super market bought some food and enjoyed our first outdoor meal.</description>
