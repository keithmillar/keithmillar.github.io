      <description>A bit windy today but decided to take the plunge and brave the C-12 to Flix wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad.
Our First Passage On A Barca
{{ more }}
I decided on a short run due to the wind and not knowing the roads , fairly easy spin with some very poor road surface, which was made up for by a newly resurfaced section on a fast twisty decent.
On a whim I turned on to the back road into Flix and at the top of a steep hill found Flo photographing a sign, we both continued on to Flix only to find our route blocked by the river, luckily for us there was a free ferry across the river although it was one of the strangest I have come across.</description>

      <description>We decided to have Easter here in Turis and travel to Cordoba on Easter Monday, when most of the Spanish traffic is heading home from Hols. This turned out to be a good decision as the volume of traffic on the other carriage way was considerable. We also had two good coffee stops which eased the trip. One stop was a place called Alacon an old fortified town over looking a river and Dam, our first coffe and cake of the trip the next stop was in a service station which was also very good with a great hunting shop.</description>

      <description>We left Aubeterre-sur-Dronne around 09:30 after coffee and a bun a lovely bright morning for a change but much colder.
{{ more }} We arrive at Urrugne around 14:30 and quickly found the camp-site after a long but enjoyable drive. This was by far the nicest day so far with the temperature rising all the way here. Once we got settled in I showered and shaved, then we took Lotti for a walk and looked for somewhere to eat no luck in that department so we drove up to the nearest super market bought some food and enjoyed our first outdoor meal.</description>

      <description>All went well on the boat Lotti survived no problem at all. Everything was on time, the boat was nearly empty so no delays getting off.
{{ more }} We drove to Loyet and found the site no lighting, raining and the first night in Blu, got sorted reasonably well nothing to eat and nowhere open. Watched a movie on Flo&amp;rsquo;s Tablet (American Hustle)</description>
