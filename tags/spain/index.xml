      <description>We left Aubeterre-sur-Dronne around 09:30 after coffee and a bun a lovely bright morning for a change but much colder.
{{ more }} We arrive at Urrugne around 14:30 and quickly found the camp-site after a long but enjoyable drive. This was by far the nicest day so far with the temperature rising all the way here. Once we got settled in I showered and shaved, then we took Lotti for a walk and looked for somewhere to eat no luck in that department so we drove up to the nearest super market bought some food and enjoyed our first outdoor meal.</description>

      <description>All went well on the boat Lotti survived no problem at all. Everything was on time, the boat was nearly empty so no delays getting off.
{{ more }} We drove to Loyet and found the site no lighting, raining and the first night in Blu, got sorted reasonably well nothing to eat and nowhere open. Watched a movie on Flo&amp;rsquo;s Tablet (American Hustle)</description>
