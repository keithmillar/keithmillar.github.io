      <description>&lt;p&gt;October got under way quietly I caught a nasty cold which got into my chest and lingered for most of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An early highlight was Flo&amp;rsquo;s birthday to celebrate We booked a table in La Font the place was buzzing and the food was very good, being a Saturday the whole world was on show.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lunched with Sarah and Steve at the little Thai in Torrent, and Sarah was telling us about her plans for some long distance rides next year, we arranged to meet at the Honey Festival in Montroy next month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
