      <description>This month was a bit more eventful than last month. I started to get some serious miles in on the bike and I managed to get my first 100 miler of the year today (28th). However the weight loss is not going to plan so I will have to work on this.
On th 7th Amber Louise O&amp;rsquo;Brien was born so the following Sat we headed down to Dublin for the usual ooing and aahing, even got to see Barbra breast-feeding!</description>
