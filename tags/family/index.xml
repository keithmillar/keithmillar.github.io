      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2019-11-07&lt;/strong&gt; Garth and Helena arrive today up early to get to the airport for 09:05 arrival. The flight was on time but unfortunately their bikes didnâ€™t make it, so after a lot of hanging around we where told they would be on the 14:00 flight from Zurich and we could collect them at 16:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking with the plan we went to Bonaire for some groceries and a coffee then home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garth and I went back to the airport and collected the bikes. Once home we rebuilt the bikes had our tea and walked to Real for a coffee in Isabella Pasteleria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This month was a bit more eventful than last month. I started to get some serious miles in on the bike and I managed to get my first 100 miler of the year today (28th). However the weight loss is not going to plan so I will have to work on this.
On th 7th Amber Louise O&amp;rsquo;Brien was born so the following Sat we headed down to Dublin for the usual ooing and aahing, even got to see Barbra breast-feeding!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being the coldest Winter on record in Northern Ireland, and Christmas Day tempatures of -12 it was touch and go if we would be able to get to Fiona and John&amp;rsquo;s for our Lunch. Luckly the roads where clear of snow and we arrived in god time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
