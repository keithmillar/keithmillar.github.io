      <description>Shane Guerin, Lotti&amp;rsquo;s vet reviewed her progress today for the first time since her operation. Thankfully all is well and Lotti is doing much better than he anticipated. Now she can enjoy room confinement as opposed to the cage and 10 minute walks. Also the medication has been drastically reduced.

Dropping her off at 9:35 without any breakfast did not go down well, after the initial meet and greet she would have happily come back home with us, however that wasn&amp;rsquo;t to be.
After reviewing her x-ray the vet was very happy with her progress all seem well we can now increase the length of her walks over the new four weeks when she will have another appointment with the vet.</description>

Got her home and it was like she never had any surgery, except for the stitches and the shaved leg, we had to stop her from running outof the vet&amp;rsquo;s.</description>
