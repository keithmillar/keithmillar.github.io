      <description>&amp;ldquo;The race organisers have given in to the inevitable and the North West 200 road races have been abandoned.&amp;rdquo;
Most of the spectators had already given up and left their positions on the circuit.
The grandstand at the start/finish line is empty and there is a great sense of frustration here as we have managed just a couple of laps of action.
Five races were scheduled for today but only two circuits of the Supersport class were completed before that race was red flagged when a rider came off his bike at Church Corner.</description>
