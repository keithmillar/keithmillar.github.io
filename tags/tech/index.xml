      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lenovo.com/uk/en/&#34;&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; for nearly a month now and I am very pleased with it. It is much larger than my previous Sony CS1.&#xA;{{ more }}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This computer is probably the fastest that I have ever owned with an Intel® Core™ i7-4700MQ @ 2.40GHz processor and 12GB ram, it came with Windows 8 which I upgraded to 8.1 before I installed any software, and I also removed all the crapware, of which there was plenty. The keyboard in nice to use but the trackpad is a disaster with the buttons integrated into the pad and it is offset left of center which is just wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a steep learning curve but I think it has been worth the effort, many of the problems with Jekyll have been a mixture of my ignorance and the devs breaking various parts of Jekyll.&#xA;{{ more }}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a greater understanding of the mechanics of Jekyll and ruby gems, and I can at least remove and replace broken gems which is a big plus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Git on the other hand still remains mostly a mystery I can just about do the most basic of things this will have to be address this coming year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
