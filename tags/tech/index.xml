      <description>I have had my Lenovo for nearly a month now and I am very pleased with it. It is much larger than my previous Sony CS1. {{ more }}
This computer is probably the fastest that I have ever owned with an Intel® Core™ i7-4700MQ @ 2.40GHz processor and 12GB ram, it came with Windows 8 which I upgraded to 8.1 before I installed any software, and I also removed all the crapware, of which there was plenty.</description>

Git on the other hand still remains mostly a mystery I can just about do the most basic of things this will have to be address this coming year.</description>
