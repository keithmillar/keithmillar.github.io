      <description>Garth arrived on 18th at 05:30 and with him came the first snow of the year and freezing temperatures. After Breakfast in the travelodge it was of to Maria&amp;rsquo;s to get the dart into Dublin.
Off the DART and a cold busy Dublin awaited us. A quick walk around the city centre with a visit to HMV and the Post Office on O&amp;rsquo;Connell Street, which was pretty much the original building.</description>
