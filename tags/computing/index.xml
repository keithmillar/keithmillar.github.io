      <title>Finally Moved to Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steep learning curve and at least a Month later I have the blog running on &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, after about 7 years on Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main issue I have had with Jekyll is the dependency on Ruby Gems, these need regular updating and can break the rendering of the site, hopefully &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; being self contained will not suffer from this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have had my Lenovo for nearly a month now and I am very pleased with it. It is much larger than my previous Sony CS1. {{ more }}
This computer is probably the fastest that I have ever owned with an Intel® Core™ i7-4700MQ @ 2.40GHz processor and 12GB ram, it came with Windows 8 which I upgraded to 8.1 before I installed any software, and I also removed all the crapware, of which there was plenty.</description>

      <title>Flashed Flo&#39;s Phone with a CyanogenMod Rom</title>

      <description>After a huge amount of fannying around Flo finally decided to to install a new rom on her HTC Wildfire, we followed the Instructions on this web site wiki.cyanogenmod.org and everything went fairly smoothly. The main reason she wanted to do this was the orignal rom was full of google apps which she didn&amp;rsquo;t use, and the phone was running out of space so she could not install Facebook, and google refuse to allow you to remove their apps.</description>

      <description>Started off the day in the garden raking up leaves, and then we cut back the honeysuckle and found a fancy mushroom growing under the bush.
I have been hearing a strange noise from kzone, so I finally ran smartctl on it and to my horror discovered that all the drives where showing errors. I decided to replace the drive containing the OS straight away, which ment a trip to PC World for a new WD 500GB HD but coffee in Castle Espie was more inportant and being Sunday the shops hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet opened.</description>

      <description>Started to get a feel for emacs to day, and it did take nearly all day. Finding information is not a problem finding current and relevant info can be a real challenge. How ever I did get the colour theme working and formatted the date in the calendar for European formatting. I even added the Moto GP and World Super Bike dates. Now all I have to do is put it all all together and start org mode.</description>

      <description>Spoke to Garth this afternoon, he was clearing out the Helena&amp;rsquo;s house in Birmingham, and had already made several trips to the dump. Sara had been round with a friend who bought the Cooker, Washing Machine and I think the Fridge. Garth already board managed a run as well. Hopefully he will be over Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.
Started to learn EMACS today worked through the basic manual and have made more progress than in the past, so far it has been relatively straight forward (I hope).</description>

      <description>As normal with Gentoo when things start to go wrong they just keep getting worse. First kdepy4 gave trouble had to downgrade sip, that sort of fixed that. Then kdepim4 wouldn&amp;rsquo;t compile, ended up leaving it, hopefully it will be fixed in the next few days. Must spend some time tidying up portage keywords etc.</description>

      <description>Updated the members services section of the website today, as normal ended up doing it twice first time to prove that I did&amp;rsquo;nt like what I had and then to improve on that.
For what ever reason I thought I would try and get a script to upload this blog to fastmail using NCFTPP found a nice wee bash script then spent several hours trying to get it working, eventually success and it seemed to work well.</description>

      <description>Cleaned the Kitchen today, all the units on the outside,then the floor and cooker. Saved the inside of the cupboards for another day. Managed to break the light under the cupboard.
Then I spent the afternoon trying to copy Helena&amp;rsquo;s emails etc from Outlook, waiting for the outlook.ost file to download to see if it will run on my computer.
Once again the club email is screwing with me, changed the email from address to fausto and all hell broke loose, sorted with flo&amp;rsquo;s help then the mail was unreadable in fastmail, not sure if this was just a glitch in the space time continuum or or the character encoding was wrong so I altered the encoding.</description>

      <description>Started today off with a nice cycle and of course Coffee in Mountstewart, weather for once was quite nice but cold, dry roads for the first time in what seems like weeks.
This afternoon I decided to try and install Pie Crust a web site generator,I think I have it working just need to discover how to create content. Of course before I could install Pie Crust I had to tidy up my test web sites so some where deleted, and I move Pie Crust &amp;amp; Chronicle to the virtual host directory on kzone.</description>
