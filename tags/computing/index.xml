      <title>Busy Sunday</title>

      <description>Started off the day in the garden raking up leaves, and then we cut back the honeysuckle and found a fancy mushroom growing under the bush.
I have been hearing a strange noise from kzone, so I finally ran smartctl on it and to my horror discovered that all the drives where showing errors. I decided to replace the drive containing the OS straight away, which ment a trip to PC World for a new WD 500GB HD but coffee in Castle Espie was more inportant and being Sunday the shops hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet opened.</description>

      <description>Removes spaces in file names and replaces them with
{% highlight bash html %} for file in ; do mv &amp;ldquo;$file&amp;rdquo; echo $file | sed -e &#39;s/ */-/g&#39; -e &#39;s/_-_/-/g&#39;; done {% endhighlight %} or {% highlight bash html %} find . -depth -name &amp;lsquo; *&amp;rsquo; | while IFS= read -r f ; do mv -i &amp;ldquo;$f&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;$(dirname &amp;ldquo;$f&amp;rdquo;)/$(basename &amp;ldquo;$f&amp;rdquo;|tr &amp;lsquo; &amp;rsquo; _)&amp;rdquo; ; done {% endhighlight %}</description>

      <description>AFAIK that is because the dri and dri2 modules from xorg-x11(mesa) opengl setup are not in path. I worked around this by
{% highlight bash html linenos %} Quote: Section &amp;ldquo;Files&amp;rdquo; ModulePath &amp;ldquo;/usr/lib/xorg/modules&amp;rdquo; ModulePath &amp;ldquo;/usr/lib/opengl/xorg-x11/extensions/&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; EndSection {% endhighlight %}</description>

      <title>Reloading the Mutt Configuration File</title>

      <description>I find it a bit annoying that I have to re-enter my password twice every time I (re-)start mutt when I want to update my configuration file. Well, it appears I don&amp;rsquo;t need to be doing restarting mutt. The MuttWiki describes a way to re-load the configuration after mutt is running. Type the following into mutt after you&amp;rsquo;ve changed your muttrc file:  :source /path/to/your/muttrc Note that shell expansions may not work&amp;mdash;you should spell out the full path.</description>

      <description>Started to get a feel for emacs to day, and it did take nearly all day. Finding information is not a problem finding current and relevant info can be a real challenge. How ever I did get the colour theme working and formatted the date in the calendar for European formatting. I even added the Moto GP and World Super Bike dates. Now all I have to do is put it all all together and start org mode.</description>

      <description>Spoke to Garth this afternoon, he was clearing out the Helena&amp;rsquo;s house in Birmingham, and had already made several trips to the dump. Sara had been round with a friend who bought the Cooker, Washing Machine and I think the Fridge. Garth already board managed a run as well. Hopefully he will be over Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.
Started to learn EMACS today worked through the basic manual and have made more progress than in the past, so far it has been relatively straight forward (I hope).</description>

      <description>As normal with Gentoo when things start to go wrong they just keep getting worse. First kdepy4 gave trouble had to downgrade sip, that sort of fixed that. Then kdepim4 wouldn&amp;rsquo;t compile, ended up leaving it, hopefully it will be fixed in the next few days. Must spend some time tidying up portage keywords etc.</description>

      <description>Updated the members services section of the website today, as normal ended up doing it twice first time to prove that I did&amp;rsquo;nt like what I had and then to improve on that.
For what ever reason I thought I would try and get a script to upload this blog to fastmail using NCFTPP found a nice wee bash script then spent several hours trying to get it working, eventually success and it seemed to work well.</description>

      <description>Cleaned the Kitchen today, all the units on the outside,then the floor and cooker. Saved the inside of the cupboards for another day. Managed to break the light under the cupboard.
Then I spent the afternoon trying to copy Helena&amp;rsquo;s emails etc from Outlook, waiting for the outlook.ost file to download to see if it will run on my computer.
Once again the club email is screwing with me, changed the email from address to fausto and all hell broke loose, sorted with flo&amp;rsquo;s help then the mail was unreadable in fastmail, not sure if this was just a glitch in the space time continuum or or the character encoding was wrong so I altered the encoding.</description>

      <description>Started today off with a nice cycle and of course Coffee in Mountstewart, weather for once was quite nice but cold, dry roads for the first time in what seems like weeks.
This afternoon I decided to try and install Pie Crust a web site generator,I think I have it working just need to discover how to create content. Of course before I could install Pie Crust I had to tidy up my test web sites so some where deleted, and I move Pie Crust &amp;amp; Chronicle to the virtual host directory on kzone.</description>
