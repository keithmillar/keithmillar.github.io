      <description>Out for a spin with Flo again today. Trying to find the road from Turis to Chiva was like looking for a needle in a haystack, finaly Flo found it and we had shorter reverse of Sundays run, with Coffee in Monserrat.
Spent the evening watching a distant thunder storm from the pool, no sound just the light show. Today&amp;rsquo;s route was Altury, Turis, Godelleta, Monserrat, Montroy, Real and Turis.</description>

      <description>Arrived in Achill around 16:00 minus a cake&amp;hellip;.

The drive was fairly uneventful but we do need to find a better coffee stop on the way as Fivemile town isn&amp;rsquo;t up to scratch. Cycling and coffee tomorrow WP.</description>

      <description>Coffee and Grocery Shopping this morning then back home for Lunch. Flo fancied going to one of the television masts and view points but as soon as we left the house the mist came down and the wind got even stronger. When we got there, there where some guys painting the mast could not believe anyone would work in such poor and dangerous conditions
Having seen the waves from the mountain we decided to have a closer look, the wind was wild and the mist very low but the beach was great, and the wind surfers worth watching.</description>

      <description>The drive to Keem Beach was very hilly with great scenery, the beach it&amp;rsquo;s self was fantastic got some good shots of Lotti and flo. Luckily we had finished when a Coach load of tourists arrived so it was time to leave.
Drove round to the abandoned Village and then more Coffee where we watched some poor unfortunates trying to break into their car.
We walked to Alices Bar for some food and meet some Canadians from Novia Socia looking for directions, naturally we got soaked both ways heavy rain and strong winds but still quit mild.</description>

      <description>Need some supplies and coffee, The Village Bakery provided the first of many coffee stops and I wanted a look round the hardware store which turned out to be what we expected a mix of the old and new.
We drove to Newport and around Furnace lake and back to Achill for lunch. I thought we could walk lotti round the shore and back up a river on to the road but the beginning of the river proved illusive so we gave up and took Lotti back the way we came, leaving her in the house we walked back along the road to the top of the river and then followed it to the sea, not an easy walk good job we left Lotti home and of course the rain returned and we got soaked but it was good fun.</description>
