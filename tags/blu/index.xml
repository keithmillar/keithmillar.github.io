      <description>Took Blu down to Quinton Bay for a shake down run since we completed her internal build earlier in the week.
{{ more }} All went well gas worked so we had tea and coffee, just a matter of being organised with the necessary gear for our travels I think it will require quite a few trips to sort everything out.
Played around with the mythtv it did work, likely need a better aerial or change the tuner.</description>

      <description>Not a lot posted about Blu in recent weeks / months, due mainly to being away on holiday in Canada with Garth &amp;amp; Helana. Now that we have been back for few weeks and Flo got her act together and we ordered a kitchen from Evodesign, which took around two weeks to arrive meaning another delay.
{{ more }} The flat pack arrived last Thursday and we started to assemble it over the course of the weekend.</description>

      <description>Finally finished the vans insulation, passenger door much easier with Flo helping, still a bit of a pig. Also fix the roof so here&amp;rsquo;s hoping. {{ more }} Having watched the Blackbird chicks quite closely for over a week now the seem to have fledged early this afternoon when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking.
Since it is such a nice afternoon we took a spin down to Ballywalter and sat watching the world go by, while enjoying an ice cream, as we sat the mist cleared and the wind dropped a wonderful end to the day.</description>
