&lt;p&gt;Well it took a bit longer than we thought but we finally got the bottom half of the garden upgraded with new Flower beds, and we replace the moss and grass with membrane and stones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Naturally the school never maintain any thing so it is up to us to cut the trees which are putting the garden into shade in the early afternoon, 3 hours later we had just about finished but decided to wait until tomorrow afternoon so we could see if any more need cutting.</description>

      <description>With the weather remaining excellent for this time of year, we have got lots of things done. Thanks to Tim who supplied some manure , we where able to plant our Veg garden Broccoli, Carrots, Sweet Pea, Strawberries and Corvettes.
Easter Tue and it was the Club Easter Ramble to Newcastle, an over cast cool windy day and busy roads, 12 of us did the ride with lunch in Mauds. This was my second 100 miler this month, I thing the fact that the club where all in Mallorca doing big miles helped with the motivation and once again April is my highest mileage month so far.</description>
