      <description>&lt;p&gt;After much procrastinating we made a start to the fire, Built up the back and sides with some small bricks then we tiled the hearth with black tiles. We ran out of time to do the surround, that will have to wait for another day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>With the weather remaining excellent for this time of year, we have got lots of things done. Thanks to Tim who supplied some manure , we where able to plant our Veg garden Broccoli, Carrots, Sweet Pea, Strawberries and Corvettes.&#xA;Easter Tue and it was the Club Easter Ramble to Newcastle, an over cast cool windy day and busy roads, 12 of us did the ride with lunch in Mauds. This was my second 100 miler this month, I thing the fact that the club where all in Mallorca doing big miles helped with the motivation and once again April is my highest mileage month so far.</description>
