      <description>Near perfect conditions for our bike ride today little wind and very warm. The ride turned out to be a lot easier than I thought.
{{ more }} Hard to believe shorts no arm warmers at the end of Sept and it was 21c at one time. We decided not to go to Keel as it is all on the main road. Luckily the route brought us to the coffee shop where we watched the world go by.</description>
