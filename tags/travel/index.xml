      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got moving just after 09:00, staying on the CV-50 we drove through Liria ans eventually on to the CV-25 to Olocav, Marines, Gatova and down to Segorbe. This turned out to be a lovely road climbing for 14km not too steep and ending with a great open descent into Segorbe, well worth revisiting for a cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We decided to have Easter here in Turis and travel to Cordoba on Easter Monday, when most of the Spanish traffic is heading home from Hols. This turned out to be a good decision as the volume of traffic on the other carriage way was considerable. We also had two good coffee stops which eased the trip. One stop was a place called Alacon an old fortified town over looking a river and Dam, our first coffe and cake of the trip the next stop was in a service station which was also very good with a great hunting shop.</description>

      <description>Last day and no Flo so Marty has free rain to do his worst, fortunately Marty was tired and I was able to keep up with out too much trouble, once again it was a good day cycling with a couple of big hills and two quick coffee stops.
We stayed close to the hotel tonight where we enjoyed a good meal at a good price.
All in all it was a great trip the cycling was good especially once we got up into the hills and away from the tourist areas, the apartment was excellent and over all the food good and at the right price.</description>

      <description>Marty tried to find a flatter route today mainly for Rob who was suffering right from the off. We went along the coast after getting lost coming out of Albufeira, the roads where quite busy around here as it is the main tourist area.
It was my turn for the coffee today and naturally I go stuck for the most expensive of the week €13.20 in a nice little spot called Carveoiro.</description>

Once we got settled in we took another taxi to collect our hire bikes from BikeLand, the bikes are ok but below average condition.
The 3 of us the went for a spin to get the feel of the bikes and the terrain, we even managed a coffee.</description>

      <description>Arrived at the airport with sufficient time for an easy check in although the place was busier than we expected due probably to it being a bank holiday, any all went smoothly and we collect luggage and hire car with minimal fuss and we where on our way.

Our first port of call was Valencia airport to pick up Mairead, then Turis to the shops for some necessary food and beer.</description>

      <description>This is the first St Patricks day Parade I can ever remember going to, and where better than Cork for the first one. A big surprise for me was how multi cultural it was with most countries represented. A massive effort had been made by many to have the best floats with the Indian Yoga being on of the best.

Did my Bowbell route this morning very windy once again but it turned out not as nasty as it could have been. Talked to Noel about the Rider Support Program and he was of the same opinion as myself, in that it was a bit elitist, and most of the club would not benefit from the program.</description>

      <description>March saw a trip to Cork to visit Flo&amp;rsquo;s uncle Hugh, who had just had a pacemaker fitted. On arriving at Valentine Villas Hugh was no where to be found, after some searching we found him down at the Lough watching the world going by. He was in great form and as up to date with everything as usual .
The weather was great, cold but bright and sunny so I was able to get on the bike with John on Sunday and Tuesday , on Sunday we went with some local cyclists to Fermoy and Tuesday we went to Bandon &amp;amp; Kinsale, two good 50 plus mile runs.</description>

      <description>On the 5th October we flew to Alicante and collected a battered hire for the drive to Valencia, as one would expect the weather was fabulous. The drive was uneventfull and we arrived at John &amp;amp; Mairead&amp;rsquo;s house mid after noon, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t take us long to get the wine on the go.
Sunny Spain
Happy 50th Birthday Flo
With glass in hand we enjoyed the weather for the rest of the day.</description>

      <description>Walls Of Derry
Walls Of Derry
Week two and we found ourselves in the Everglades Hotel Londonderry, arriving quite late after a trip to Chain Reaction Cycles and a lovely lunch in the Galgorm Manor. Once we had checked in to the hotel Flo was busting a gut to explore the Walls of Derry, after finding a parking place off we set. Walking through a deserted town center past the Guild Hall we climb on to the walls, taking a anti-clockwise course we explored the walls.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday 31st August we travelled to Ballaghadereen Co Roscommon and the Abbeyfield hotel for 3 nights, on the drive down the weather was fantastic, stopping for coffee in Carrick-on-Shannon, on the way in to Ballaghadereen I spotted a car parts shop which we visited the next day to get a replacement Ariel for the car. On arrival in Ballaghadereen and after checking in to the hotel we went out for a short drive to see what was available for food, but we decided to eat in the hotel bar.</description>

      <description>Spent some of our 12th weekend in the now traditional Kilraine. This year Richard And Yuk were also staying with their little girl Hannah. Lotti and Hannah spent most of the time avoiding each other, except in lottis case when there was the chance of Hannah dropping food.

Monday was a nice day so off we all went to the Waterford &amp;amp; Suir Valley Railway, and a 50 minute (12km) journey in the above train.</description>

      <title>Big Month for Miles</title>

      <description>April is traditionally a month of big mileage, or at least has been since our club started going to Mallorca for a weeks Cycling.
This year was no exception I managed almost 800 miles before our departure on Sat 24th, however I only managed one ride over 80 miles, the bulk being around 40 - 50 miles.
Suddenly all our training looked to have been in vain as a volcano erupted in Iceland and closed most of european air space for nearly a week, leaving many people stranded abroad and many loosing holidays completely, however our luck held and the wind changed direction blowing volcanic ash away, and so on the 24 our flight departed Belfast for Palma.</description>

      <description>Not much happening at this time of year, so the start of the month was fairly quite. However we had a weekend away planned for the very end of the month in Co Roscommon.
Lough Key
We drove down to Ballghadereen Co Roscommon on Friday night, the drive to Enniskillen was woeful due to road works but when we crosssed the border it turned into a lovely bright moon lite night.</description>

      <description>Drove up on friday afternoon traffic was light, which gave us time to admire the sunset. Fantastic as it was it was a precursor to the wild weather forecast for late Friday night and Saturday.
Arrived at the Magherabuoy House Hotel around 16:30 and relaxed in our rooms, then went for a drink in the bar and our comp meal in the hotel restaurant. An early night ready for tomorrow.</description>
