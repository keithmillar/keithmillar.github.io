      <description>On the 5th October we flew to Alicante and collected a battered hire for the drive to Valencia, as one would expect the weather was fabulous. The drive was uneventfull and we arrived at John &amp;amp; Mairead&amp;rsquo;s house mid after noon, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t take us long to get the wine on the go.

Happy 50th Birthday Flo
With glass in hand we enjoyed the weather for the rest of the day.</description>

      <description>Walls Of Derry
Walls Of Derry
Week two and we found ourselves in the Everglades Hotel Londonderry, arriving quite late after a trip to Chain Reaction Cycles and a lovely lunch in the Galgorm Manor. Once we had checked in to the hotel Flo was busting a gut to explore the Walls of Derry, after finding a parking place off we set. Walking through a deserted town center past the Guild Hall we climb on to the walls, taking a anti-clockwise course we explored the walls.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday 31st August we travelled to Ballaghadereen Co Roscommon and the Abbeyfield hotel for 3 nights, on the drive down the weather was fantastic, stopping for coffee in Carrick-on-Shannon, on the way in to Ballaghadereen I spotted a car parts shop which we visited the next day to get a replacement Ariel for the car. On arrival in Ballaghadereen and after checking in to the hotel we went out for a short drive to see what was available for food, but we decided to eat in the hotel bar.</description>

      <description>Spent some of our 12th weekend in the now traditional Kilraine. This year Richard And Yuk were also staying with their little girl Hannah. Lotti and Hannah spent most of the time avoiding each other, except in lottis case when there was the chance of Hannah dropping food.

      <title>Big Month forÂ Miles</title>

      <description>April is traditionally a month of big mileage, or at least has been since our club started going to Mallorca for a weeks Cycling.
This year was no exception I managed almost 800 miles before our departure on Sat 24th, however I only managed one ride over 80 miles, the bulk being around 40 - 50 miles.
Suddenly all our training looked to have been in vain as a volcano erupted in Iceland and closed most of european air space for nearly a week, leaving many people stranded abroad and many loosing holidays completely, however our luck held and the wind changed direction blowing volcanic ash away, and so on the 24 our flight departed Belfast for Palma.</description>

      <description>Not much happening at this time of year, so the start of the month was fairly quite. However we had a weekend away planned for the very end of the month in Co Roscommon.
Lough Key
We drove down to Ballghadereen Co Roscommon on Friday night, the drive to Enniskillen was woeful due to road works but when we crosssed the border it turned into a lovely bright moon lite night.</description>

      <description>Drove up on friday afternoon traffic was light, which gave us time to admire the sunset. Fantastic as it was it was a precursor to the wild weather forecast for late Friday night and Saturday.
Arrived at the Magherabuoy House Hotel around 16:30 and relaxed in our rooms, then went for a drink in the bar and our comp meal in the hotel restaurant. An early night ready for tomorrow.</description>
