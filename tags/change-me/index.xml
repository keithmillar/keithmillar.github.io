      <description>Another beautiful morning here in Altury warm and sunny, just finishing off the packing and almost ready to go.
{{ more }} Quite a long drive today and of course the weather is looking great, made good time to Barcelona and then we got diverted because of road works and lost a lot of time driving through the City, we finally got on to the coast road and back on track.</description>

A late breakfast and we all went to Montroy Castle and reoriented ourself with the layout of the land, then down to Real for a Coffee, then back home and the Bar La Rambla where we had the Menu del Dia.
We spent the evening in Bonaire Shopping Centre.
My Yoga class has finished which meant we could do Flo&amp;rsquo;s Altury Agri walk which Lotti had to miss as we had another walk planned for tomorrow.</description>
