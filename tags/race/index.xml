Friday The challenge event is starting to feel a bit more real today as we opened registration and the vendors set up their wares. Flo and I counted the barriers at the swim and bike transition. Then when Garth was free we check out Bike course especially the turn on to and off the highway, where we will be marshalling on the day.</description>

      <description>Having stumbled across this event on the web, I thought I would mention it to Marty, big mistake &amp;ldquo;always wanted to do one of those&amp;rdquo;Â was his immediate reaction and that was it we were now fully committed. I spent the rest of the week looking for an excuse not to go but no really good one came to mind so on Friday I found myself checking over the BeOne for the adventure to follow.</description>

      <description>Arrive early so we went for a coffee, then panicked when we look up the hill and saw that there was already loads of people on the climb. Struggled up the hill and got a really good spot on the left about three quarters of the way up.
