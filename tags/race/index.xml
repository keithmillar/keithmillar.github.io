Friday The challenge event is starting to feel a bit more real today as we opened registration and the vendors set up their wares. Flo and I counted the barriers at the swim and bike transition. Then when Garth was free we check out Bike course especially the turn on to and off the highway, where we will be marshalling on the day.</description>

Darrell with Garth after the run {{ more }} We stopped of at Gina and Errols this morning and collect a nice Kona CX bike for me to ride while we are here.
Then it&amp;rsquo;s off to Grand Bay-Westfiels for the Canada Day 10 mile road race, Garth running in the 10k race which he won even though Alex Coffin messed up the finish which apparently was Garth&amp;rsquo;s fault.</description>

      <description>Having stumbled across this event on the web, I thought I would mention it to Marty, big mistake &amp;ldquo;always wanted to do one of those&amp;rdquo;Â was his immediate reaction and that was it we were now fully committed. I spent the rest of the week looking for an excuse not to go but no really good one came to mind so on Friday I found myself checking over the BeOne for the adventure to follow.</description>
