      <description>Fogy and damp this morning but no wind to speak of and quite warm, so a good day to tackle the Greenway.
{{ more }} We rode from Achill to Newport via the Great Western Greenway ,easy going with only one steep section at Mullranny. The most interesting part is from Achill to Mullranny, with some nice views of the loughs. From Mullranny to Newport is very flat open moorland not the best when the wind is blowing.</description>

      <description>The weather forecast for Sunday was dire, rain and gale force winds. Flo had already decide to do the Marie Curie on Saturday and I didn&amp;rsquo;t fancy the Ards run on Sunday so the Marie Curie it was.
{{ more }}
Quite a few of the Club where going to Downpatrick so I joined them in Ards and we took the quite back roads to the start at Downpatrick race course, with Flo driving down and getting an early start on her own with the intention of me catching her later.</description>

      <description>Almost perfect conditions tonight for the road race light winds warm and dry. This has to be one of the best marshalled club events I have ever been at thanks in part to the Peninsula Tri club.
{{ more }}
Numbers where down on the usual mob that descends on Kirkistown, probably because this was a road course with hills and sharp corners. There where 3 groups on the road Ladies &amp;amp; over 50s, over 40s and senior riders with each group riding to win a club jersey in their respective class.</description>

      <description>Once again the club ran the Coast Challenge which saw 950+ cyclists take to the roads around the peninsula.
{{ more }} The atmosphere at this years event was on of the best yet due in no part to the mild dry day and the new sign on area, which seemed to allow people to mingle better. Once again Flo and her sign on team did a great job and everything went very smoothly.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The race organisers have given in to the inevitable and the North West 200 road races have been abandoned.&amp;rdquo;
Most of the spectators had already given up and left their positions on the circuit.
The grandstand at the start/finish line is empty and there is a great sense of frustration here as we have managed just a couple of laps of action.
Five races were scheduled for today but only two circuits of the Supersport class were completed before that race was red flagged when a rider came off his bike at Church Corner.</description>

      <description>Visited the Ulster today for an update on my broken Clavicle, managed to get an early appointment (09:15) hoping that we would beat the cues.
{{ more }} I was called quite quickly and as expected sent to the x-ray department for a current x-ray. Back to the fracture clinic and I was seen by the Dr I was first seen by a few days after my accident and he was please with my progress, and in fact discharged me there and then, but not before I saw a Physo.</description>

      <description>Lovely weather on Sat and I was stuck inside on the turbo not too happy so I decided if Sunday was a nice day I would brave the road on Flo&amp;rsquo;s Mountain Bike.
{{ more }} Sunday arrived and looked promising, so taking the bull by the horns off we set to join the Haw Rd run. All went well no pain etc except for one scare when someone fell off in front of me at a junction.</description>

      <description>Finally January has given way to February and not soon enough as far as I am concerned, the weather has been appalling wet dull and cold and that was a good day, in fact it was the dullest Jan for 50yrs in some parts of the country.

The drive down was not great due to heavy traffic, and a couple of accidents so it was 21:00 when we arrived starving but more of that later.</description>

Managed to get around the Peninsula ok felt a bit tired on some of the drags on the way home, to be expected I suppose considering the head wind we hand on the way down. Once again the riding in the group left a lot to be desired.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Garth and Helena went back home on Saturday morning, after the normal dire service we have come to expect in our airports. So Flo and I went back to bed, well Flo did I did some things on the computer related to this blog, oh yes just rembered I changed the YAML front matter to suit the Jekyll blog software that I intend to use. Then we dandered down the town and had coffee. The rest of the day I think we lazed around and watched TV.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

No way would I have started if they hadn&amp;rsquo;t come up. It was warm which was about the best you could say, anyway I quite enjoyed the day.
After showers etc. we went to the Parlour at the Old Cross for tea, first time here and it was grand.</description>

      <description>A dry morning at last took the new bike round the Peninsula this morning, it rode well but after talking to Garth I think I will change the bars to the same as my other bikes, the drops are just much nicer. The gears are much crisper when changing.</description>

      <description>Well to day finally came, never really thought it would. Woke up an Flo had lots of cards and presents for me to open, but the special one was my new Focus Cayo fortunately it was too wet to go out on it.
Using the old reliable Cannondale I went for coffee in Bowbells and got soaked on the way there. Friday evening We meet up with the Perrys and McCoshes in Daft Eddys for a meal and some crac, we had a great night and the children where very well behaved.</description>

      <description>West Down GP was run off on a lovely sunny day with a brutal wind which once again put a damper on the racing. A bunch speint it was with a down hill and tail wind assisted finish at over 40 mph I decided to let this one pass
On Sunday Flo and I went out for a spin to Daft Eddys, it was a lovely day but Flo was a bit sick so we had to cut the run short.</description>

      <description>Time for the North Down GP, where do I start. Lots of talk in the days before the race, needless to say all a lot of hot air. Once again NDCC riders chasing each other down and even trying to knock each other off during the KOH Prem The head wind to D’dee helped keep a lid on the race as no one would ride in the wind, but tha tail wind on the Warren Rd made for a very fast run over Orlock , I Suppose the Finish line crash was more or less inevitable with riders dying and switching all over the place.</description>

      <description>I rode the Rás Loughguile today, the race started in lovely sunshine but we where soon meet with driving hail and when we went over Ora it snowed.I got away on the second lap when the first of the hail started and managed to stay away for a whole lap, I was nearly caught but the hail returned and the bunch eased off. On the Climb of Ora a smal group got away and because of the filthy conditions they managed to stay away to the finish, several crashes on the descent saw some riders face down in the bog.</description>

      <description>Fitted new forks, brakes &amp;amp; cables and a front mech to the Fuji. I also put new FSA compact bars on the Red Cannondale and my Felt, I have not been able to try the Felt yet but the Cannondale is fantastic, I can ride on the drops for long periods with out any problems, so I have ordered a set for the Fuji.
I had just finished all this when Flo complained about a clicking noise coming from the rear of Coppi, Further examination showed the rear wheel was nackered, hub and drive side cones gone, so I ordered a wheel from Chain Reaction, my next job when we get back from Cork on Monday.</description>

      <description>Easter Saturday was a lovely day and I enjoyed the club run to Portaferry, nice and fast on the way down helped by the brisk tail wind. On the way back everyone was quite relaxed with few changes if any, my legs where still stiff from Thursday so I opted not to go over the Brae.
Sunday and Monday where very unproductive with Paris Roubaix and then MotoGP both of which where compelling viewing, Boonen&amp;rsquo;s win in Roubaix was fantastic as was lorenzo&amp;rsquo;s in Qatar.</description>

Huge field 80 riders and the usual morons who can&amp;rsquo;t ride there bikes. Ended in a bunch sprint pushing and shoving all over the place. Flo and Lotti where my support team and Flo got some great Photos and even managed to feed me</description>

On sat we rode the club run to Portaferry, I was caught short and stopped but I was unable to catch the group, luckily they stopped for coffee and I was able to join them for the rest of the ride.</description>

      <description>Spoke to Garth this after noon and he has book a Flight on Thursday to Heathrow arriving at 20:30 he will be staying in the Nova hotel and driving to Birmingham on Friday morning. Must ring him on Sat unless he get me first.
Did my Bowbell route this morning very windy once again but it turned out not as nasty as it could have been. Talked to Noel about the Rider Support Program and he was of the same opinion as myself, in that it was a bit elitist, and most of the club would not benefit from the program.</description>

      <description>Headed over to Dromara and on over Dree Hill today, not sure it was one of my better ideas. Dree Hill was as hard as usual I was even chased up by a hedge cutter, but we got there in the end, alough I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had enough to eat and I ran out of energy on the way home, a hard day as it was a head wind out and quite cold.</description>

This afternoon I decided to try and install Pie Crust a web site generator,I think I have it working just need to discover how to create content. Of course before I could install Pie Crust I had to tidy up my test web sites so some where deleted, and I move Pie Crust &amp;amp; Chronicle to the virtual host directory on kzone.</description>

      <description>Rest day over and the legs felt slightly better, today is a long ride to Galway and the weather is damp to start with. Today turned out to be one of the best days riding yet, a nice cross tail wind warm and sunny. Once again the pace was fast for such a long day 138 miles.
Galway to Donegal Town via Sligo, where I finally lost patents with Noel who was continual going faster in heavy traffic, just too dangerous trying to keep up.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we reached the half way point of our trip, and a hard old slogg it&amp;rsquo;s been. Saturday was the longest day with busy roads and some showers early on, I could have easily stopped there and then it was just a horrible day, But we Finely reached Wicklow.
Sunday started with heavy rain and strong cross winds, which soon turned into a strong head wind which was to be with us untill we reached Mizzen on Tuesday.</description>

      <description>The day started badly when updating kzone from my phone while still in bed, the job failed for no reason. After breakfast and much googling and one false start, I discovered that a backup job which ran during the night had copied files locally and filled the drive, after deleting them, all was back to normal. Getting sidetracked I was looking on the web when the monitor went dark. Out came the laptop and PC World had them in stock reserved one to collect and off we went to collect it, guess what, correct none in stock except display models, wasted journey.</description>

      <description>Road the Tour of the Glens today for the first time in about eight years. We had the best weather for many a year, except for the brutal 60 mile cross head wind all the way home. The wind was so strong that in places I could not take my hand off the bars to drink, and I was nearly blown off on the battery. Apart for the wind the ride was great with the hills not seeming as hard as I remembered, perhaps it was the blue sky and warm sunshine.</description>

      <description>With the weather remaining excellent for this time of year, we have got lots of things done. Thanks to Tim who supplied some manure , we where able to plant our Veg garden Broccoli, Carrots, Sweet Pea, Strawberries and Corvettes.
Easter Tue and it was the Club Easter Ramble to Newcastle, an over cast cool windy day and busy roads, 12 of us did the ride with lunch in Mauds. This was my second 100 miler this month, I thing the fact that the club where all in Mallorca doing big miles helped with the motivation and once again April is my highest mileage month so far.</description>

      <description>March saw a trip to Cork to visit Flo&amp;rsquo;s uncle Hugh, who had just had a pacemaker fitted. On arriving at Valentine Villas Hugh was no where to be found, after some searching we found him down at the Lough watching the world going by. He was in great form and as up to date with everything as usual .
The weather was great, cold but bright and sunny so I was able to get on the bike with John on Sunday and Tuesday , on Sunday we went with some local cyclists to Fermoy and Tuesday we went to Bandon &amp;amp; Kinsale, two good 50 plus mile runs.</description>

      <description>Well this month was pretty uneventful, started to get some good miles in on the bike after a disastrous December. Dry but cold with little in the way of wind which is always good.
Noel called a meeting about the around Ireland challenge, Daren was there to offer advice on training and nutrition all things we know but choose to forget. I decided to try some long zone two rides both for endurance and weight loss, time will tell how that goes.</description>

Probably the best day I have ever had on a Mountain bike.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday 31st August we travelled to Ballaghadereen Co Roscommon and the Abbeyfield hotel for 3 nights, on the drive down the weather was fantastic, stopping for coffee in Carrick-on-Shannon, on the way in to Ballaghadereen I spotted a car parts shop which we visited the next day to get a replacement Ariel for the car. On arrival in Ballaghadereen and after checking in to the hotel we went out for a short drive to see what was available for food, but we decided to eat in the hotel bar.</description>

      <description>This year Flo rode the short course and finished 4th, not bad when you consider there was over 200 entries. John Preston came up from Cork and also rode the short course and finished 11th in his class, after his mate made him turn off this heart monitor.
I had a horrible day started off well enough riding to my heart rate on the long road section but once we went off road I started getting cramps which eventually forced me to cut the course and ride back via the road.</description>

      <description>Many weeks hard work by lots of club members paid off as this years event was one of the best yet. Superb weather saw close to 800 riders taking part. For the first time since we started running the event I was able to take photos at will, with most people happy to pose for me. The atmosphere at Barr Hall was great with everyone taking time to have lunch in the warm sunshine.</description>

Arriving early was a god send, we parked in the railway station right next to sign on, and then where able to sign just before the masses arrived. After signing on and collecting our jerseys we headed back to the car to await the start.</description>

      <description>April is traditionally a month of big mileage, or at least has been since our club started going to Mallorca for a weeks Cycling.
This year was no exception I managed almost 800 miles before our departure on Sat 24th, however I only managed one ride over 80 miles, the bulk being around 40 - 50 miles.
Suddenly all our training looked to have been in vain as a volcano erupted in Iceland and closed most of european air space for nearly a week, leaving many people stranded abroad and many loosing holidays completely, however our luck held and the wind changed direction blowing volcanic ash away, and so on the 24 our flight departed Belfast for Palma.</description>

      <description>Rode the Dromara Hilly 125 today after much debate, woke to pleasant morning so I had no more excuses. Not having made any travel arrangements with the club I drove down on my own and was pleased that Eric, Ian, Trevor, Noel, Harry and the Old Pro (Brian) had also made the trip, content now that I would have some good wheels to sit on I started looking forward to the days ride.</description>
