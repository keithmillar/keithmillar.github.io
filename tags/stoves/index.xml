      <description>&lt;p&gt;After much procrastinating we made a start to the fire, Built up the back and sides with some small bricks then we tiled the hearth with black tiles. We ran out of time to do the surround, that will have to wait for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next project is to fit a Pellet Stove which we bought from Leroy Merlin, easy to fit got it up and running quickly. However when the wind blows it causes major problems as the stove blows back and fills the house with smoke, as a best solution we moved the flue away from the wall we may need to raise it above the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought a Tilt 900 from Decathlon same as Flo&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowed a Rotavator from C&amp;amp;A went over it a couple of times, going to leave it a couple of days and I will do it again, so now the garden is ready for planting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
