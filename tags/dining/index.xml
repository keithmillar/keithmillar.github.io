      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally after much procrastinating we got round to having John and Fiona over for a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ more }}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flo worked hard to produce a great spread of food, which was devoured along with several bottles of wine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was nice to be able to return the compliment for the Christmas dinners we have enjoyed at their house.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was good catching up and finding out what Mark and Lisa where doing, both seem well on the way to careers of their own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty years, doesn&amp;rsquo;t time fly and so far so good. May and Carole gave us a voucher at Christmas for Daft Eddys so it only seemed right that we use it towards our anniversary celebrations. Lots of new staff so we where a bit concerned incase the food wasn&amp;rsquo;t up to the usual standard, but it was even better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ more }}&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After Flo had to cancle her second weeks holiday when she hurt her back she booked this week off.&#xA;Monday and we went to the new James Bond film Skyfall which was very good and we got the cinema almost to our selves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ more }}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday we both went out on our bikes and I meet up with Flo in Bowbell and we came back with the club.&#xA;Thursday we went into Belfast for lunch and a look around town. The town was very quite which suited me fine, Flo took me to Murial&amp;rsquo;s for lunch which was nice. Great to see Belfast becoming a proper city with tourests and people doing normal things.&#xA;Sunday and Judy was up for the Irish Experts Trial which was cancled so we went to the Parlour for a meal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Frank and Kath spent the weekend with us and on Sat night we went to Zen for a meal, as to be expected it was very nice great atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ more }}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sunday and we went to the new titanic expo in Belfast, very well done for a change it looks like we have got something right although I suspect our politicians had little to do with it. To finish the day off we had Afternoon Tea and very nice it was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This evening turned out to be quite busy, first I had an interview with Tesco in Newtownards and then more importantly Flo&amp;rsquo;s Birthday dinner at Daft Eddys.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The interview seemed to go well even though I had to wait for one of the interviewers. Needless to say I was declined a couple of weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The weather cleared up a little bit when we got to Daft Eddys and was very calm with a lovely sunset over the bay. As to be expected the food was great, and the company wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad either.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not a hard course just hope I can continue in the same vain in the coming races. Great day for the club as the two Noels took first and second in the over 50&amp;rsquo;s race while Matty won the A3 race.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Headed over to Dromara and on over Dree Hill today, not sure it was one of&#xA;my better ideas. Dree Hill was as hard as usual I was even chased up by a&#xA;hedge cutter, but we got there in the end, alough I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had enough&#xA;to eat and I ran out of energy on the way home, a hard day as it was a head&#xA;wind out and quite cold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
