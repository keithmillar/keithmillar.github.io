<p>&ldquo;The race organisers have given in to the inevitable and the North West 200 road races have been abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="/images/2013/2013-05-18.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Most of the spectators had already given up and left their positions on the circuit.</p>
<p>The grandstand at the start/finish line is empty and there is a great sense of frustration here as we have managed just a couple of laps of action.</p>
<p>Five races were scheduled for today but only two circuits of the Supersport class were completed before that race was red flagged when a rider came off his bike at Church Corner.</p>
<p>It is disappointing, but there is nothing the organisers can do. They put in a year&rsquo;s planning - but it all comes down to the weather on the day</p>
