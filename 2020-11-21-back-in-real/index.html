<br><br>
<p>Return to Spain. Just set a provisional date of 18th. Ended up booking for the 19th so Flo could get one more Italian class.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020/" alt=""></p>
<p>Lotti good result from the vet. Blood work showed an improvement and a slight weight gain, leading the vet too suggest treatment for Alzheimer&rsquo;s, which we decided to try. This was the news we where waiting for and aloud us to book the boat to France.</p>
<p>In the mean time we called to Hurst on the off chance of a test drive in a  Duster, very impressed car drove well for 1300 petrol, diesel should be better. That&rsquo;s our due diligence done.</p>
<p>Dinner Date with Marty and Pam before we head off and to repay their hospitality nice evening good food from Flo as one would expect.</p>
<p>Finished Packing Blu and bikes on just a few last minute things tomorrow before we leave.<br>
On Our Way all last minute jobs done departed 11:30 no covid-19 stop on border now a head of schedule. Stopped for fuel and a burger to kill some time arrived Dublin Port 14:15 now waiting for check-in to open.</p>
<p>Bumpy crossing compared with our last couple. Very old boat the Epsilon, not many cars. Lotti is on a open deck which isn&rsquo;t ideal but she did good and enjoyed a prime spot with lots to watch.</p>
<p>Boat was an hour late but we cleared the port by 16:00 with barley a look from the Police and no questions re covid-19 never mind a test.  We made good progress and the rain cleared to leave the perfect driving conditions. About 250km short of Bordeaux we stopped at the weirdest McDonald&rsquo;s ever, no lights, restaurant half built, only drive through open and massive que. Stopping for fuel in Bordeaux and San Sebastian, also a driver change we continued on making good progress, with one Coffee stop which revived us both. No sign of the police anywhere on route or no covid-19 test. Arrived Real 10:30 cold and sunny.</p>
<p>Straight back to work with some little jobs first. Trimmed the bathroom door. Sanded front window so it would close.</p>
<p>Back to Ikea and Bauhaus for some essentials Before picking up our stove in Monserrat.</p>
<p>To install the stove first I had to fit a Lintel. Original was too long, while Flo got a shorter one I prepared the wall. A nice dry mix of cement and it&rsquo;s in place. Chilling out. Sitting in front of our log burner which we installed today 28th.</p>
<p>Car Shopping. Back to Ikea, in and out like a rocket. Then Torrent to look at cars, not very inspiring so we raced over to Chiva before siesta. Different approach here guy really sold us the car and he spoke English. All things been equal we may buy from here.</p>
<p>2020-11-27 We just put a deposit on a Duster.</p>
<p>2020-11-30 Solar panels fitted to roof. Five months after taking delivery of the panels they are finally being installed in the optimum spot on the front of the roof.</p>
