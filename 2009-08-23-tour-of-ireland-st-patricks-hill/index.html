<p>Arrive early so we went for a coffee, then panicked when we look up the hill and saw that there was already loads of people on the climb. Struggled up the hill and got a really good spot on the left about three quarters of the way up.</p>

<strong>Writting on the Road</strong></p>
<p>Waited for about an hour and where enterined by the kids having a ball writing on the road, with chalk provided by the <a href="http://www.livestrong.org">Livestrong Foundation</a> . Well with perfect timing the first rider appeared and the heavens opened, within minutes the water was running down the street like a river.</p>

<p>Russell Downing race leader lead a small group of riders up the hill on his way to a well deserved tour win. As usual these guy made the 25% gradient look easy as they powered their way to the top and on to the next lap.</p>
