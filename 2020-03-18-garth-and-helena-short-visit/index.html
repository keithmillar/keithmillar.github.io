<p>Garth and Helena arrived on time, collected hire car and we zoom off to Bonaire for shopping and coffee, with the weather improving things are looking good for the next couple of weeks, it only we new.

<p>After a nice spin on the canals with a stop in Catadau, the first disappointment of the week was the cancellation of my Tous Ride.</p>

<p>Thursday with the temps in the mid 20s Garth and I went for another spin on the Chiva Turis route, after we got home we discovered that the 1\2 marathon in Elche has been postponed.</p>
<p>Friday we decided on a day off and some retail therapy with a visit to Bonaire and back to Decathlon for the things we couldn&rsquo;t get in Torrent last night, but first Flo and I managed to finalise the bank account with BBVA in Torrent so we now have a Spanish bank account.</p>
<p>A nice spin to day (Saturday) to Bunol and over the climb to Yatova once again nice and warm, back home and we find out Spain is implementing a State of Emergency from Monday, so Garth and Helena rebook their flights for Tuesday, a big disappointment but this will have a massive impact on their Travel Business.</p>
<p>Sunday we go for a drive to the beach and already it&rsquo;s apparent the lock down is having an immediate effect, all bars closed and the roads deserted.</p>
