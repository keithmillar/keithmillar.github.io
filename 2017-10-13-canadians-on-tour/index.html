<strong>Day 2 - Cap de Formentor</strong></p>
<p>All good today early start was great got to the lighthouse well before the traffic because it was manic when we left with vast numbers for cars heading up.</p>

<p>After a shower Flo and I walked to Cal San Vinenƒç Which was beautiful I enjoyed a beer and a tostie now going for another shower.</p>
<p><strong>Day 3 - Rest Day</strong></p>
<p>Set out to reccy Thursdays route, stopped in Can Picafort for a coffee and to make a plan. Settled on a route to Muro where we stopped for Lunch. We headed to Sa Pobla and the over to Campanet to find a coffe spot for tomorrow (Monday) and then back to Sa Pobla for the end of Thursdays ride.</p>
<p><strong>Day 4 - Ermita Santa Magdalena</strong></p>
<p>Long day, but nice ride, coffee shop was a bit of a cockup change of venue didn&rsquo;t work  Campanet would have been much more pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>Day 5 - Can Picafort</strong></p>
<p>Big changes for the group as we decided to split in run into three groups by ability. This turned out to be very successful with know one put under pressure. We even managed to arrive within a few minutes of each other at the coffee stop. Traffic was a bit heavy but manageable. Good ride.</p>
<p><strong>Day 6 - Palma bus trip</strong></p>
<p>Everyone set off 9:30 on the bus to Palma where they where due to spend the day. G&amp;H headed out to do there own thing while Flo and I went to Arta to get a Tee Shire for Marty and while there we grabbed a coffee and wandered around some shops.</p>
<p>Luckily we got back just in time to catch the finish a road race taking part on the island today.</p>
<p>Finished off a nice day with a meal in Cashmere the local Indian restaurant then ice cream and beer in Grand Cafe 1919. Great company G&amp;H Darel and Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>Day 7 - Rain Spoils Play</strong></p>
<p>As predicted wet today, so groups being ferried to the Albufera for a hikes. While some of us remain here for Yoga with Earl.</p>
<p>Day 9 - Sa Calobra</p>
<p>Today worked out well got to the climb quite fresh and with minimal hanging around. I felt I was able to ride hard all the way to the top   and took nearly 7 mins off last week&rsquo;s time.
I think all that rode with us today enjoyed it a lot and achieved a lot. The hikers also had a good day with their highest walk so far.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/2017-10-13-canadians-on-tour-5.jpg" alt="Sa Calobra"><strong>Back on Sa Calobra</strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/2017-10-13-canadians-on-tour-6.jpg" alt="Sa Calobra"><strong>Sa Calobra for the last time</strong></p>
<p>Day 10 - Sa Pobla, Buger, Campanet, Selva and Lluc</p>
<p>Great ride today nice roll out then a blast to Lluc with Earl and Garth making things hard with Earl finally getting the better of us, then back to Campanet for a well earned  coffee. Can&rsquo;t believe that this is our final   day in Mallorca.
Nice group dinner tonight lots of crack, and prizes galore then out for our final meeting</p>
