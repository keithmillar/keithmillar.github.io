<p>We went for a walk to the Hermita but not before finding a bar for a coffee.</p>

<p>The walk up to the Hermita was fairly easy, with exceptional views of the surrounding area although it was hot their was a nice cooling breeze. The walk back down was much easier as we took the road.</p>

<strong>The Hermita</strong></p>
<p>This area is known for it climbing and there where two groups doing there thing on the rocks.</p>
<p>We went back into the town to the same bar we where in earlier and enjoyed a lovely lunch.</p>
<p>To finish off a great day we took Lotti into Flix for an ice cream and a beer. She seems to have gotten over her humpines after the exploding tyre.</p>
