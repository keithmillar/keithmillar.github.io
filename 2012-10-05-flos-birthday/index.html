<p>This evening turned out to be quite busy, first I had an interview with Tesco in Newtownards and then more importantly Flo&rsquo;s Birthday dinner at Daft Eddys.</p>
<p>The interview seemed to go well even though I had to wait for one of the interviewers. Needless to say I was declined a couple of weeks later.</p>
<p>The weather cleared up a little bit when we got to Daft Eddys and was very calm with a lovely sunset over the bay. As to be expected the food was great, and the company wasn&rsquo;t bad either.</p>
