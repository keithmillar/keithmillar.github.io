<p>Finally feels like we are making some progress, tiled the kitchen and installed a new bathroom window and the last cupboard door became available in Ikea which allowed us to finish the kitchen cabinets.</p>
<p>At long last C M Nagar gave us a date when he will put up the patio. Pepe &amp; Aaron arrived on the 15th and the patio is now in place.</p>

<p>Table and 2 benches reserved for the patio from the second hand shop in Montroy have been collected and are now in place, I think they look fantastic.</p>
<p>Removed the old bathroom window to replace it with a nice new tilt and turn window which lets in much more light.</p>
<p>Heavy rain all day, but we had arranged lunch with Amanda and Charlotte in Montserrat. Then we remembered tomorrow is a holiday and we need wood, went and collected that near Godaletta.</p>
