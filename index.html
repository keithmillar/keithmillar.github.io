        <p>Garth and Helena having left on the 17th March and arrived safely back in Canada, now face 14 days self quarantine, very disappointing to miss out on their company. This has left Flo and I not quite knowing what to do, or what the coming days will bring.</p>

        <p><strong>2019-11-07</strong> Garth and Helena arrive today up early to get to the airport for 09:05 arrival. The flight was on time but unfortunately their bikes didn’t make it, so after a lot of hanging around we where told they would be on the 14:00 flight from Zurich and we could collect them at 16:00.</p>
<p>Sticking with the plan we went to Bonaire for some groceries and a coffee then home.</p>
<p>Garth and I went back to the airport and collected the bikes. Once home we rebuilt the bikes had our tea and walked to Real for a coffee in Isabella Pasteleria.</p>
