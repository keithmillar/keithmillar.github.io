        Flo and I went to the vets Lunch in the Esplanade, this was the first time Flo had been to one of these and I several years since I had been to one. Turned out not too bad food was good but as usual service was slow. This year the Club had laid on a comedian, heard worse. {{ more }}
On Friday the 9th we headed down to Cork, via a visit to Trish.

        McCool Hikers Day 1 After meeting G&amp;H on Friday evening we stayed with Judi and did some catching up.
Sat morning was dull windy and very mild 18c at 07:30, after breakfast we headed into Phoenix park heavy traffic and going the wrong way meant we where late and missed the group arrival, however after much searching we gave up and went and watched the start of the race.

        Took Blu down to Quinton Bay for a shake down run since we completed her internal build earlier in the week.
{{ more }} All went well gas worked so we had tea and coffee, just a matter of being organised with the necessary gear for our travels I think it will require quite a few trips to sort everything out.
Played around with the mythtv it did work, likely need a better aerial or change the tuner.

        Leaving for the Causeway the weather looked a bit dodgy, but quite mild at 16c for the time of year, and the closer we got to Ballintoy the poorer it became to the point it was raining slightly. However as we arrived in Ballintoy the sky started to clear and the sun threatened to shine. While Flo drove to the Giants Causeway and parked Blu, then got the bus back Lotti and I walked down to the Carrick-a-Rede bridge and enjoyed a Coffee in the sun outside the gift shop, watching tourists running from there tour buses to the rope bridge.

        Not a lot posted about Blu in recent weeks / months, due mainly to being away on holiday in Canada with Garth &amp; Helana. Now that we have been back for few weeks and Flo got her act together and we ordered a kitchen from Evodesign, which took around two weeks to arrive meaning another delay.
{{ more }} The flat pack arrived last Thursday and we started to assemble it over the course of the weekend.

        Piss poor morning but the weather forecast said it would improve. Looking from our bedroom window I could see Donard, so we took a punt and off we went.
{{ more }}
Caught the Bus to Bloody Bridge (£2.00pp one way) and started walking, this time we found the easier path to the Quarry, once at the Quarry the going get slightly harder under foot until you reach the wall. Once at the wall the hard stuff begins this time I crossed the wall as under foot it was much better, nearing the top the wall has collapsed and boulders are strewn across the mountain so I crossed back over the wall and continued to the summit, to be joined by Flo about 30 mins later.
