        Being the coldest Winter on record in Northern Ireland, and Christmas Day tempatures of -12 it was touch and go if we would be able to get to Fiona and John&rsquo;s for our Lunch. Luckly the roads where clear of snow and we arrived in god time.
Once again the whole family put on a great spread of food and drink and a great day was had by all. It was good to see Kathleen, Fiona, Mark and Lisa once again.

        After The Cooley Challenge we had promised John that we would go to Ballyhoura, after a dismal drive down in pouring rain on friday, Saturday turned out a lovely bright sunny day. 21 miles and two and a half hours later we had compleated the white run, lots of flowing single track on well maintained paths. Probably the best day I have ever had on a Mountain bike.

        On the 5th October we flew to Alicante and collected a battered hire for the drive to Valencia, as one would expect the weather was fabulous. The drive was uneventfull and we arrived at John &amp; Mairead&rsquo;s house mid after noon, and it didn&rsquo;t take us long to get the wine on the go.
Sunny Spain
Happy 50th Birthday Flo
With glass in hand we enjoyed the weather for the rest of the day.

Walls Of Derry
Week two and we found ourselves in the Everglades Hotel Londonderry, arriving quite late after a trip to Chain Reaction Cycles and a lovely lunch in the Galgorm Manor. Once we had checked in to the hotel Flo was busting a gut to explore the Walls of Derry, after finding a parking place off we set. Walking through a deserted town center past the Guild Hall we climb on to the walls, taking a anti-clockwise course we explored the walls.
