Flo worked hard to produce a great spread of food, which was devoured along with several bottles of wine.
It was nice to be able to return the compliment for the Christmas dinners we have enjoyed at their house.
It was good catching up and finding out what Mark and Lisa where doing, both seem well on the way to careers of their own.

{{ more }} We walked from Keem beach up along the cliffs and back down through the valley about 4 miles inall, and once a fantastic day. Looking out over the Atlantic the views where spectacular.
Stopped on the way back for the necessary coffee in Gielty&rsquo;s.

        Near perfect conditions for our bike ride today little wind and very warm. The ride turned out to be a lot easier than I thought.
{{ more }} Hard to believe shorts no arm warmers at the end of Sept and it was 21c at one time. We decided not to go to Keel as it is all on the main road. Luckily the route brought us to the coffee shop where we watched the world go by.
