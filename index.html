	<i data-feather="calendar"></i> <span>29 Mar, 2022</span>
        <p>We finished the shed and then tiled the floor, just getting the floor finished before the rains set in. The tiles made such a difference when it rains, before the floor flooded, with the tiles the floor stays dry with a couple of small dribbles coming in near the house. To finish off the shed we bought a work bench from Bauhaus built it and installed it, great job lots of Stuff now organised.</p>
<p>Luckly we completed the shed just before the rain arrived on the 16th and it only stopped raining on Sunday 27th according to Aemet it is the wettest March since 1948</p>

        <p>Went to Spanish class tonight and I new it was a mistake, all the old prejudices came to light even the building was the same shit design as every school I have ever been in. Even managed to get a Dutch swot sitting beside me making lovely little notes. Still would like to learn some of the language.</p>
