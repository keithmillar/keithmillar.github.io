        We left Aubeterre-sur-Dronne around 09:30 after coffee and a bun a lovely bright morning for a change but much colder.
{{ more }} We arrive at Urrugne around 14:30 and quickly found the camp-site after a long but enjoyable drive. This was by far the nicest day so far with the temperature rising all the way here. Once we got settled in I showered and shaved, then we took Lotti for a walk and looked for somewhere to eat no luck in that department so we drove up to the nearest super market bought some food and enjoyed our first outdoor meal.

        All went well on the boat Lotti survived no problem at all. Everything was on time, the boat was nearly empty so no delays getting off.
{{ more }} We drove to Loyet and found the site no lighting, raining and the first night in Blu, got sorted reasonably well nothing to eat and nowhere open. Watched a movie on Flo&rsquo;s Tablet (American Hustle)

        This turned out to be a totally manic month, having committed ourselves to Spain on the 13th of December and a stressful visit to Cork on the 17th, with the van not even half finished it was all hands on deck.
{{ more }}
Lots of internet searching and Flo found a guy down south selling a Waco Fridge and a cooker, naturally that was too simple, and to avoid p+p we decided to meet him in Newry on the 10th and pick them up.

        Karen&rsquo;s annual trip coincided with some nice weather so we went to Castle Ward. {{ more }}
It was convenient that this was also one of the walks we had to do for Garth&rsquo;s walking tour next September. The place was jumping as there was a Family Fun Day for Halloween.
For Garth&rsquo;s Tour I think we should walk in the other direction.

        Last day and no Flo so Marty has free rain to do his worst, fortunately Marty was tired and I was able to keep up with out too much trouble, once again it was a good day cycling with a couple of big hills and two quick coffee stops.
We stayed close to the hotel tonight where we enjoyed a good meal at a good price.
All in all it was a great trip the cycling was good especially once we got up into the hills and away from the tourist areas, the apartment was excellent and over all the food good and at the right price.

        Took My bike back to BakeLand as the rear wheel was hitting the rear brake, not a nice ride as the road surface was bad and the traffic very heavy. Marty once again sorted a good route with two coffee stops in Loule and Alte. Loule was a nice spot bustling little town.

Flo became a Pensioner today so she got to chose the restaurant this evening and she picked Big Shanghai and it was great.
