        <p>Due to the greed of airlines, airports etc Garth&rsquo;s flight to Montreal
was cancelled, luckily he was able to get it rebooked for the next day and Helena got his return extended by one day. One day late but on time Garth finally arrived in Valencia. We took him to Bonaire for lunch then home to build his bike.</p>

<p>On good Friday we drove to Camprodon in Girona to meet with Kenny and his Partner Andrew for a 3 day trial in Sant Joan de les Abadesse. We stayed in the hotel Puig Francó owned by a trials enthusiastic, so the hotel has a trials theme all the rooms are named after famous riders and loads of motor cycle pictures adorned the walls.</p>

	<i data-feather="calendar"></i> <span>29 Mar, 2022</span>
        <p>We finished the shed and then tiled the floor, just getting the floor finished before the rains set in. The tiles made such a difference when it rains, before the floor flooded, with the tiles the floor stays dry with a couple of small dribbles coming in near the house. To finish off the shed we bought a work bench from Bauhaus built it and installed it, great job lots of Stuff now organised.</p>
<p>Luckly we completed the shed just before the rain arrived on the 16th and it only stopped raining on Sunday 27th according to Aemet it is the wettest March since 1948</p>
