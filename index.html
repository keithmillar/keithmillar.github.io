        Started off the day in the garden raking up leaves, and then we cut back the honeysuckle and found a fancy mushroom growing under the bush.
I have been hearing a strange noise from kzone, so I finally ran smartctl on it and to my horror discovered that all the drives where showing errors. I decided to replace the drive containing the OS straight away, which ment a trip to PC World for a new WD 500GB HD but coffee in Castle Espie was more inportant and being Sunday the shops hadn&rsquo;t yet opened.

Sunday morning and I had planned a ride out with John. As is the norm with John all is not what it seem and he has a test the next day, and only wanted a short easy ride, but he had made arrangements for me to go with his new club Aqua Blue.
