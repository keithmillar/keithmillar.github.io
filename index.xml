      <description>First we went to Thunder Hole then a 4 mile walk in ANC. Lovely warm day blue sky, very hard walking nearly vertical in places more of a scramble. Passed an elderly couple who were having a hard time, little did they know worse was to come. When we returned to the car park we spoke to the range and informed her about them just in case they got into difficulty.</description>

      <description>Rest day over and the legs felt slightly better, today is a long ride to Galway and the weather is damp to start with. Today turned out to be one of the best days riding yet, a nice cross tail wind warm and sunny. Once again the pace was fast for such a long day 138 miles.
Galway to Donegal Town via Sligo, where I finally lost patents with Noel who was continual going faster in heavy traffic, just too dangerous trying to keep up.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we reached the half way point of our trip, and a hard old slogg it&amp;rsquo;s been. Saturday was the longest day with busy roads and some showers early on, I could have easily stopped there and then it was just a horrible day, But we Finely reached Wicklow.
Sunday started with heavy rain and strong cross winds, which soon turned into a strong head wind which was to be with us untill we reached Mizzen on Tuesday.</description>

      <description>The day started badly when updating kzone from my phone while still in bed, the job failed for no reason. After breakfast and much googling and one false start, I discovered that a backup job which ran during the night had copied files locally and filled the drive, after deleting them, all was back to normal. Getting sidetracked I was looking on the web when the monitor went dark. Out came the laptop and PC World had them in stock reserved one to collect and off we went to collect it, guess what, correct none in stock except display models, wasted journey.</description>

      <description>Road the Tour of the Glens today for the first time in about eight years. We had the best weather for many a year, except for the brutal 60 mile cross head wind all the way home. The wind was so strong that in places I could not take my hand off the bars to drink, and I was nearly blown off on the battery. Apart for the wind the ride was great with the hills not seeming as hard as I remembered, perhaps it was the blue sky and warm sunshine.</description>

      <description>With the weather remaining excellent for this time of year, we have got lots of things done. Thanks to Tim who supplied some manure , we where able to plant our Veg garden Broccoli, Carrots, Sweet Pea, Strawberries and Corvettes.
Easter Tue and it was the Club Easter Ramble to Newcastle, an over cast cool windy day and busy roads, 12 of us did the ride with lunch in Mauds. This was my second 100 miler this month, I thing the fact that the club where all in Mallorca doing big miles helped with the motivation and once again April is my highest mileage month so far.</description>

      <description>March saw a trip to Cork to visit Flo&amp;rsquo;s uncle Hugh, who had just had a pacemaker fitted. On arriving at Valentine Villas Hugh was no where to be found, after some searching we found him down at the Lough watching the world going by. He was in great form and as up to date with everything as usual .
The weather was great, cold but bright and sunny so I was able to get on the bike with John on Sunday and Tuesday , on Sunday we went with some local cyclists to Fermoy and Tuesday we went to Bandon &amp;amp; Kinsale, two good 50 plus mile runs.</description>

      <description>This month was a bit more eventful than last month. I started to get some serious miles in on the bike and I managed to get my first 100 miler of the year today (28th). However the weight loss is not going to plan so I will have to work on this.
On th 7th Amber Louise O&amp;rsquo;Brien was born so the following Sat we headed down to Dublin for the usual ooing and aahing, even got to see Barbra breast-feeding!</description>

      <description>Well this month was pretty uneventful, started to get some good miles in on the bike after a disastrous December. Dry but cold with little in the way of wind which is always good.
Noel called a meeting about the around Ireland challenge, Daren was there to offer advice on training and nutrition all things we know but choose to forget. I decided to try some long zone two rides both for endurance and weight loss, time will tell how that goes.</description>

      <description>After The Cooley Challenge we had promised John that we would go to Ballyhoura, after a dismal drive down in pouring rain on friday, Saturday turned out a lovely bright sunny day. 21 miles and two and a half hours later we had compleated the white run, lots of flowing single track on well maintained paths. Probably the best day I have ever had on a Mountain bike.</description>

The drive was uneventfull and we arrived at John &amp;amp; Mairead&amp;rsquo;s house mid after noon, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t take us long to get the wine on the go.

Week two and we found ourselves in the Everglades Hotel Londonderry, arriving quite late after a trip to Chain Reaction Cycles and a lovely lunch in the Galgorm Manor. Once we had checked in to the hotel Flo was busting a gut to explore the Walls of Derry, after finding a parking place off we set. Walking through a deserted town center past the Guild Hall we climb on to the walls, taking a anti-clockwise course we explored the walls.</description>

On arrival in Ballaghadereen and after checking in to the hotel we went out for a short drive to see what was available for food, but we decided to eat in the hotel bar.</description>

      <description>This year Flo rode the short course and finished 4th, not bad when you consider there was over 200 entries. John Preston came up from Cork and also rode the short course and finished 11th in his class, after his mate made him turn off this heart monitor.
I had a horrible day started off well enough riding to my heart rate on the long road section but once we went off road I started getting cramps which eventually forced me to cut the course and ride back via the road.</description>

For the first time since we started running the event I was able to take photos at will, with most people happy to pose for me. The atmosphere at Barr Hall was great with everyone taking time to have lunch in the warm sunshine.</description>

      <description>April is traditionally a month of big mileage, or at least has been since our club started going to Mallorca for a weeks Cycling.
This year was no exception I managed almost 800 miles before our departure on Sat 24th, however I only managed one ride over 80 miles, the bulk being around 40 - 50 miles.
Suddenly all our training looked to have been in vain as a volcano erupted in Iceland and closed most of european air space for nearly a week, leaving many people stranded abroad and many loosing holidays completely, however our luck held and the wind changed direction blowing volcanic ash away, and so on the 24 our flight departed Belfast for Palma.</description>

Turning left we headed to the mourne wall and the valley between Donard and Commedagh. We then followed th Mourne Wall over Commedagh and Back to the Hare&amp;rsquo;s gap and finaly back to Meelmore Lodge, covering about 9.</description>

      <description>First Cross event in a couple of years, super course but much too hard for the first event of the year. The course was more suited to mountain bikes than CX bikes with quite a severe down hill section with large rocks to be avoided. All of the course was ridable , but I was a bit over geared for some of the climbs. Four 3 mile laps with 2 severe climbs made this a tough event.</description>

      <description>We decided to go for a walk today, and after great debate I decided on Murlough Bay just outside Dundrum. So off we set just after 10:00 rather later than I would have like, but that&amp;rsquo;s the price of indecision. Arrived in the car park just before 11:00 and off we set.

Well what a surprise as we set off through the sand dunes, a board walk lead us to the beach, and fantastic views of the Mourne Mountains towering over Newcastle.</description>

      <description>Got 36 miles in today, now knackered. Going to try running tomorrow because, guess what yes it&amp;rsquo;s going to rain all day.
Good Stage in the Vuelta today.</description>

      <description>Arrive early so we went for a coffee, then panicked when we look up the hill and saw that there was already loads of people on the climb. Struggled up the hill and got a really good spot on the left about three quarters of the way up.

      <description>Rode the Dromara Hilly 125 today after much debate, woke to pleasant morning so I had no more excuses. Not having made any travel arrangements with the club I drove down on my own and was pleased that Eric, Ian, Trevor, Noel, Harry and the Old Pro (Brian) had also made the trip, content now that I would have some good wheels to sit on I started looking forward to the days ride.</description>
