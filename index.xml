      <description>&lt;p&gt;Snikket could be the perfect message and phone app for me, and my close family.  I bought a virtual raspberry pi from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mythic-beasts.com&#34;&gt;www.mythic-beasts.com&lt;/a&gt; just for the purpose of running snikket but it is not to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a very hot spell, even cycling early morning is a struggle. Not done much did fit the bike room window just before the heat got going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning 27th we got a big thunder storm which cleared the air and temps finally dropped and it remained very windy all day and into Monday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On our way to get some wood in Godelleta, We spotted a couple of cyclists at the side of the road with what appeared to be a small puppy.  We turned the car around to see if we could offer any assistance. The girl said that they found the puppy, in a drain at the side of the road, being on bikes they could do little for the dog so we offered to to look after him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/2023/2023-04-24-woody-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Woody on his way to recovery&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Woody on his way to recovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During or recent trip to Madrid we passed this shop selling all types of springs, later the same day we found a shop for leather workers selling everything from hide to tiny grommets, pliers, cutters and punches the list goes on. On our last day I found an arcade with 6 to 8 clock / watch shops again selling everything from watches , batteries, faces, glass iand tools to fit glass and many thing I could not identify. Never seen the like back home, looks to me like the Spanish repair stuff. Even back in Real it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get parts for things, we could learn from this back home.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/2023/2023-01-31-repair-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Spring Shop&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spring Shop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well December arrived rather quickly, one minute the year was ticking along and the next thing Fo was talking Christmas. I think this was partly due to Flo going home at the start of the month to catchup with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/2023/2022-12-30-christmas-dog-sitters-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Flo overlooking the Caves&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flo overlooking the Caves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We stayed in the hotel Puig Francó owned by a trials enthusiastic, so the hotel has a trials theme all the rooms are named after famous riders and loads of motor cycle pictures adorned the walls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We finished the shed and then tiled the floor, just getting the floor finished before the rains set in. The tiles made such a difference when it rains, before the floor flooded, with the tiles the floor stays dry with a couple of small dribbles coming in near the house. To finish off the shed we bought a work bench from Bauhaus built it and installed it, great job lots of Stuff now organised.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckly we completed the shed just before the rain arrived on the 16th and it only stopped raining on Sunday 27th according to Aemet it is the wettest March since 1948&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went to Spanish class tonight and I new it was a mistake, all the old prejudices came to light even the building was the same shit design as every school I have ever been in. Even managed to get a Dutch swot sitting beside me making lovely little notes. Still would like to learn some of the language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Disappointed not to get a last cycle in but the wind has been relentless all month, so I settled on a walk with Flo and the girls over in Montserrat. Then we lunched in the town.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flo and I saw in the New Year at home with the fire blazing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For many this has been a very poor year, for us it was more of an inconvenience. We managed to buy a House make it habitable, buy a car, and take up residence in Spain. Most of this was made possible by Flo&amp;rsquo;s love of paper work and her grasp of the Language and willingness to dive in and sort things out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Garth and Helena having left on the 17th March and arrived safely back in Canada, now face 14 days self quarantine, very disappointing to miss out on their company. This has left Flo and I not quite knowing what to do, or what the coming days will bring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The flight was on time but unfortunately their bikes didn’t make it, so after a lot of hanging around we where told they would be on the 14:00 flight from Zurich and we could collect them at 16:00.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sticking with the plan we went to Bonaire for some groceries and a coffee then home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Garth and I went back to the airport and collected the bikes. Once home we rebuilt the bikes had our tea and walked to Real for a coffee in Isabella Pasteleria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This turned out to be a lovely road climbing for 14km not too steep and ending with a great open descent into Segorbe, well worth revisiting for a cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One stop was a place called Alacon an old fortified town over looking a river and Dam, our first coffe and cake of the trip the next stop was in a service station which was also very good with a great hunting shop.</description>

The most interesting part is from Achill to Mullranny, with some nice views of the loughs. From Mullranny to Newport is very flat open moorland not the best when the wind is blowing.</description>

      <description>On Friday 1st we started the Fast Diet (worst name ever) which involves fasting for two days a week.&#xA;The basics of the diet are that for two days a week you limit your calorie intake to 600 cals, split between breakfast and dinner, you can drink as much calorie free drink as you want. We chose Mon and Fri to start as we where travelling on these days and food was not readily available, we plan to fast on Mon and Thur from now on.</description>

      <description>We took Lotti to the Vet&amp;rsquo;s this morning for her 4 week check up.&#xA;{{ more }}&#xA;Dropping her off at 9:35 without any breakfast did not go down well, after the initial meet and greet she would have happily come back home with us, however that wasn&amp;rsquo;t to be.&#xA;After reviewing her x-ray the vet was very happy with her progress all seem well we can now increase the length of her walks over the new four weeks when she will have another appointment with the vet.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Garth and Helena went back home on Saturday morning, after the normal dire service we have come to expect in our airports. So Flo and I went back to bed, well Flo did I did some things on the computer related to this blog, oh yes just rembered I changed the YAML front matter to suit the Jekyll blog software that I intend to use. Then we dandered down the town and had coffee. The rest of the day I think we lazed around and watched TV.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Started off the day in the garden raking up leaves, and then we cut back the honeysuckle and found a fancy mushroom growing under the bush.&#xA;I have been hearing a strange noise from kzone, so I finally ran smartctl on it and to my horror discovered that all the drives where showing errors. I decided to replace the drive containing the OS straight away, which ment a trip to PC World for a new WD 500GB HD but coffee in Castle Espie was more inportant and being Sunday the shops hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet opened.</description>

Needless to say I was declined a couple of weeks later.&#xA;The weather cleared up a little bit when we got to Daft Eddys and was very calm with a lovely sunset over the bay.</description>

      <description>Coffee and Grocery Shopping this morning then back home for Lunch. Flo fancied going to one of the television masts and view points but as soon as we left the house the mist came down and the wind got even stronger. When we got there, there where some guys painting the mast could not believe anyone would work in such poor and dangerous conditions&#xA;Having seen the waves from the mountain we decided to have a closer look, the wind was wild and the mist very low but the beach was great, and the wind surfers worth watching.</description>

      <description>Need some supplies and coffee, The Village Bakery provided the first of many coffee stops and I wanted a look round the hardware store which turned out to be what we expected a mix of the old and new.&#xA;We drove to Newport and around Furnace lake and back to Achill for lunch. I thought we could walk lotti round the shore and back up a river on to the road but the beginning of the river proved illusive so we gave up and took Lotti back the way we came, leaving her in the house we walked back along the road to the top of the river and then followed it to the sea, not an easy walk good job we left Lotti home and of course the rain returned and we got soaked but it was good fun.</description>

      <description>SENSE OF PLACE – Cruising in Cuba: The National Highway in Cuba has many stretches where you will not see another car for miles. Then when you do see one, it is an old classic like this 1950s Buick, which looks at home on the open road with the Cuban landscape of fields and mountains in the distance.

      <description>West Down GP was run off on a lovely sunny day with a brutal wind which once again put a damper on the racing. A bunch speint it was with a down hill and tail wind assisted finish at over 40 mph I decided to let this one pass&#xA;On Sunday Flo and I went out for a spin to Daft Eddys, it was a lovely day but Flo was a bit sick so we had to cut the run short.</description>

      <description>Time for the North Down GP, where do I start. Lots of talk in the days before the race, needless to say all a lot of hot air. Once again NDCC riders chasing each other down and even trying to knock each other off during the KOH Prem The head wind to D’dee helped keep a lid on the race as no one would ride in the wind, but tha tail wind on the Warren Rd made for a very fast run over Orlock , I Suppose the Finish line crash was more or less inevitable with riders dying and switching all over the place.</description>

      <description>I rode the Rás Loughguile today, the race started in lovely sunshine but we where soon meet with driving hail and when we went over Ora it snowed.I got away on the second lap when the first of the hail started and managed to stay away for a whole lap, I was nearly caught but the hail returned and the bunch eased off. On the Climb of Ora a smal group got away and because of the filthy conditions they managed to stay away to the finish, several crashes on the descent saw some riders face down in the bog.</description>

Called in on John for a chat in Douglas cycles then back home. 16:00 hours when I am writing this and the space time continuum down here is well fucked up 1 Cork hour = 10 normal hours</description>

      <description>Fitted new forks, brakes &amp;amp; cables and a front mech to the Fuji. I also put new FSA compact bars on the Red Cannondale and my Felt, I have not been able to try the Felt yet but the Cannondale is fantastic, I can ride on the drops for long periods with out any problems, so I have ordered a set for the Fuji.&#xA;I had just finished all this when Flo complained about a clicking noise coming from the rear of Coppi, Further examination showed the rear wheel was nackered, hub and drive side cones gone, so I ordered a wheel from Chain Reaction, my next job when we get back from Cork on Monday.</description>

      <description>Easter Saturday was a lovely day and I enjoyed the club run to Portaferry, nice and fast on the way down helped by the brisk tail wind. On the way back everyone was quite relaxed with few changes if any, my legs where still stiff from Thursday so I opted not to go over the Brae.&#xA;Sunday and Monday where very unproductive with Paris Roubaix and then MotoGP both of which where compelling viewing, Boonen&amp;rsquo;s win in Roubaix was fantastic as was lorenzo&amp;rsquo;s in Qatar.</description>

      <description>Started to get a feel for emacs to day, and it did take nearly all day. Finding information is not a problem finding current and relevant info can be a real challenge. How ever I did get the colour theme working and formatted the date in the calendar for European formatting. I even added the Moto GP and World Super Bike dates. Now all I have to do is put it all all together and start org mode.</description>

      <description>Spoke to Garth this afternoon, he was clearing out the Helena&amp;rsquo;s house in Birmingham, and had already made several trips to the dump. Sara had been round with a friend who bought the Cooker, Washing Machine and I think the Fridge. Garth already board managed a run as well. Hopefully he will be over Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.&#xA;Started to learn EMACS today worked through the basic manual and have made more progress than in the past, so far it has been relatively straight forward (I hope).</description>

      <description>As normal with Gentoo when things start to go wrong they just keep getting worse. First kdepy4 gave trouble had to downgrade sip, that sort of fixed that. Then kdepim4 wouldn&amp;rsquo;t compile, ended up leaving it, hopefully it will be fixed in the next few days. Must spend some time tidying up portage keywords etc.</description>

      <description>Spoke to Garth this after noon and he has book a Flight on Thursday to Heathrow arriving at 20:30 he will be staying in the Nova hotel and driving to Birmingham on Friday morning. Must ring him on Sat unless he get me first.&#xA;Did my Bowbell route this morning very windy once again but it turned out not as nasty as it could have been. Talked to Noel about the Rider Support Program and he was of the same opinion as myself, in that it was a bit elitist, and most of the club would not benefit from the program.</description>

      <description>Headed over to Dromara and on over Dree Hill today, not sure it was one of my better ideas. Dree Hill was as hard as usual I was even chased up by a hedge cutter, but we got there in the end, alough I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had enough to eat and I ran out of energy on the way home, a hard day as it was a head wind out and quite cold.</description>

      <description>Cleaned the Kitchen today, all the units on the outside,then the floor and cooker. Saved the inside of the cupboards for another day. Managed to break the light under the cupboard.&#xA;Then I spent the afternoon trying to copy Helena&amp;rsquo;s emails etc from Outlook, waiting for the outlook.ost file to download to see if it will run on my computer.&#xA;Once again the club email is screwing with me, changed the email from address to fausto and all hell broke loose, sorted with flo&amp;rsquo;s help then the mail was unreadable in fastmail, not sure if this was just a glitch in the space time continuum or or the character encoding was wrong so I altered the encoding.</description>

Passed an elderly couple who were having a hard time, little did they know worse was to come.

      <description>Rest day over and the legs felt slightly better, today is a long ride to Galway and the weather is damp to start with. Today turned out to be one of the best days riding yet, a nice cross tail wind warm and sunny. Once again the pace was fast for such a long day 138 miles.&#xA;Galway to Donegal Town via Sligo, where I finally lost patents with Noel who was continual going faster in heavy traffic, just too dangerous trying to keep up.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we reached the half way point of our trip, and a hard old slogg it&amp;rsquo;s been. Saturday was the longest day with busy roads and some showers early on, I could have easily stopped there and then it was just a horrible day, But we Finely reached Wicklow.&#xA;Sunday started with heavy rain and strong cross winds, which soon turned into a strong head wind which was to be with us untill we reached Mizzen on Tuesday.</description>

      <description>Well, its the halfway point in the trip and time to reflect on the journey so far. When planning this trip my main concern was not the huge daily mileage but the weather and in particular the wind. My concern was justified as the strong winds played a role in our progress and morale&amp;hellip;.&#xA;An early start saw 5 riders leave from Ards Town Hall, battling south westerly winds, but by the end of the day, in Wicklow, we had lost 1 rider who returned the following morning by train.</description>

Some incidents to report &amp;hellip; 1stly Peter had a run in with a small dog but not noticed until too late, skilfully avoided. John did complete the entire day, was feeing better by the time he got to Blackrock - I think the heat assisted. From Blackrock to Wicklow Noel just took one wrong road and they ended up in Greystones - they tell me its a lovely town and was well worth the visit.</description>

      <description>The day started badly when updating kzone from my phone while still in bed, the job failed for no reason. After breakfast and much googling and one false start, I discovered that a backup job which ran during the night had copied files locally and filled the drive, after deleting them, all was back to normal. Getting sidetracked I was looking on the web when the monitor went dark. Out came the laptop and PC World had them in stock reserved one to collect and off we went to collect it, guess what, correct none in stock except display models, wasted journey.</description>

      <description>Road the Tour of the Glens today for the first time in about eight years. We had the best weather for many a year, except for the brutal 60 mile cross head wind all the way home. The wind was so strong that in places I could not take my hand off the bars to drink, and I was nearly blown off on the battery. Apart for the wind the ride was great with the hills not seeming as hard as I remembered, perhaps it was the blue sky and warm sunshine.</description>

This was my second 100 miler this month, I thing the fact that the club where all in Mallorca doing big miles helped with the motivation and once again April is my highest mileage month so far.</description>

However the weight loss is not going to plan so I will have to work on this.&#xA;On th 7th Amber Louise O&amp;rsquo;Brien was born so the following Sat we headed down to Dublin for the usual ooing and aahing, even got to see Barbra breast-feeding!</description>

      <description>Well this month was pretty uneventful, started to get some good miles in on the bike after a disastrous December. Dry but cold with little in the way of wind which is always good.&#xA;Noel called a meeting about the around Ireland challenge, Daren was there to offer advice on training and nutrition all things we know but choose to forget. I decided to try some long zone two rides both for endurance and weight loss, time will tell how that goes.</description>

Walking through a deserted town center past the Guild Hall we climb on to the walls, taking a anti-clockwise course we explored the walls.</description>

      <description>This year Flo rode the short course and finished 4th, not bad when you consider there was over 200 entries. John Preston came up from Cork and also rode the short course and finished 11th in his class, after his mate made him turn off this heart monitor.&#xA;I had a horrible day started off well enough riding to my heart rate on the long road section but once we went off road I started getting cramps which eventually forced me to cut the course and ride back via the road.</description>

      <description>Many weeks hard work by lots of club members paid off as this years event was one of the best yet. Superb weather saw close to 800 riders taking part. For the first time since we started running the event I was able to take photos at will, with most people happy to pose for me. The atmosphere at Barr Hall was great with everyone taking time to have lunch in the warm sunshine.</description>

After signing on and collecting our jerseys we headed back to the car to await the start.</description>

      <description>April is traditionally a month of big mileage, or at least has been since our club started going to Mallorca for a weeks Cycling.&#xA;This year was no exception I managed almost 800 miles before our departure on Sat 24th, however I only managed one ride over 80 miles, the bulk being around 40 - 50 miles.&#xA;Suddenly all our training looked to have been in vain as a volcano erupted in Iceland and closed most of european air space for nearly a week, leaving many people stranded abroad and many loosing holidays completely, however our luck held and the wind changed direction blowing volcanic ash away, and so on the 24 our flight departed Belfast for Palma.</description>

      <description>Not much happening at this time of year, so the start of the month was fairly quite. However we had a weekend away planned for the very end of the month in Co Roscommon.&#xA;Lough Key&#xA;We drove down to Ballghadereen Co Roscommon on Friday night, the drive to Enniskillen was woeful due to road works but when we crosssed the border it turned into a lovely bright moon lite night.</description>

      <description>Drove up on friday afternoon traffic was light, which gave us time to admire the sunset. Fantastic as it was it was a precursor to the wild weather forecast for late Friday night and Saturday.&#xA;Arrived at the Magherabuoy House Hotel around 16:30 and relaxed in our rooms, then went for a drink in the bar and our comp meal in the hotel restaurant. An early night ready for tomorrow.</description>

      <description>First Cross event in a couple of years, super course but much too hard for the first event of the year. The course was more suited to mountain bikes than CX bikes with quite a severe down hill section with large rocks to be avoided. All of the course was ridable , but I was a bit over geared for some of the climbs. Four 3 mile laps with 2 severe climbs made this a tough event.</description>

      <description>We decided to go for a walk today, and after great debate I decided on Murlough Bay just outside Dundrum. So off we set just after 10:00 rather later than I would have like, but that&amp;rsquo;s the price of indecision. Arrived in the car park just before 11:00 and off we set.&#xA;Murloch&#xA;Well what a surprise as we set off through the sand dunes, a board walk lead us to the beach, and fantastic views of the Mourne Mountains towering over Newcastle.</description>

      <description>Having stumbled across this event on the web, I thought I would mention it to Marty, big mistake &amp;ldquo;always wanted to do one of those&amp;rdquo; was his immediate reaction and that was it we were now fully committed. I spent the rest of the week looking for an excuse not to go but no really good one came to mind so on Friday I found myself checking over the BeOne for the adventure to follow.</description>

Struggled up the hill and got a really good spot on the left about three quarters of the way up.&#xA;Writting on the Road&#xA;Waited for about an hour and where enterined by the kids having a ball writing on the road, with chalk provided by the Livestrong Foundation .</description>

      <description>Rode the Dromara Hilly 125 today after much debate, woke to pleasant morning so I had no more excuses. Not having made any travel arrangements with the club I drove down on my own and was pleased that Eric, Ian, Trevor, Noel, Harry and the Old Pro (Brian) had also made the trip, content now that I would have some good wheels to sit on I started looking forward to the days ride.</description>
