      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally feels like we are making some progress, tiled the kitchen and installed a new bathroom window and the last cupboard door became available in Ikea which allowed us to finish the kitchen cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We decided to concentrate on the Kitchen Garden and we are halfway through filling our 3rd skip, but we had to take a break bolloxed, 23c and heavy work but the end is near, and the garden is clear of all rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shortly after moving to Real and once we got residency sorted we purchased a Dacia Duster, then begin the long process of getting the tow-bar certified three visits to the ITV later we could finally use our tow-bar. So today we acquired a Trailer (remolques) from Ayala.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The End of 2020 And It&#39;s Not All Bad</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Disappointed not to get a last cycle in but the wind has been relentless all month, so I settled on a walk with Flo and the girls over in Montserrat. Then we lunched in the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flo and I saw in the New Year at home with the fire blazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many this has been a very poor year, for us it was more of an inconvenience. We managed to buy a House make it habitable, buy a car, and take up residence in Spain. Most of this was made possible by Flo&amp;rsquo;s love of paper work and her grasp of the Language and willingness to dive in and sort things out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month has been taken up with the mundane doing normal everyday things, Flo returning home to keep the insurance happy, getting Eddy service after an abort because of the weather.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2019-11-07&lt;/strong&gt; Garth and Helena arrive today up early to get to the airport for 09:05 arrival. The flight was on time but unfortunately their bikes didn’t make it, so after a lot of hanging around we where told they would be on the 14:00 flight from Zurich and we could collect them at 16:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking with the plan we went to Bonaire for some groceries and a coffee then home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garth and I went back to the airport and collected the bikes. Once home we rebuilt the bikes had our tea and walked to Real for a coffee in Isabella Pasteleria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got moving just after 09:00, staying on the CV-50 we drove through Liria ans eventually on to the CV-25 to Olocav, Marines, Gatova and down to Segorbe. This turned out to be a lovely road climbing for 14km not too steep and ending with a great open descent into Segorbe, well worth revisiting for a cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steep learning curve and at least a Month later I have the blog running on &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, after about 7 years on Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main issue I have had with Jekyll is the dependency on Ruby Gems, these need regular updating and can break the rendering of the site, hopefully &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; being self contained will not suffer from this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The walk up to the Hermita was fairly easy, with exceptional views of the surrounding area although it was hot their was a nice cooling breeze. The walk back down was much easier as we took the road.

      <description>A bit windy today but decided to take the plunge and brave the C-12 to Flix wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad.
Our First Passage On A Barca
{{ more }}
I decided on a short run due to the wind and not knowing the roads , fairly easy spin with some very poor road surface, which was made up for by a newly resurfaced section on a fast twisty decent.
On a whim I turned on to the back road into Flix and at the top of a steep hill found Flo photographing a sign, we both continued on to Flix only to find our route blocked by the river, luckily for us there was a free ferry across the river although it was one of the strangest I have come across.</description>

Monday to my surprise we hit Valencia via the train from Buñol. Our first stop was for chocolate in the Valor cafe where we planned the rest of the day.
Next port of call was the Miguelette and the 207 narrow steps to the top, but it was well worth it for the views of Valencia.</description>

We had been warned that there was a Loyalist Disco on at 21:00 but we where not told that as a precursor they where having a band competition so towards the end of our meal two Bands struck up a deafening racket in the small bar, sad to see that not much has really changed in the North, however the food was very good and as is to be expected the crac was mighty, we finished off the evening back at Colin and Beverly&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Leaving for the Causeway the weather looked a bit dodgy, but quite mild at 16c for the time of year, and the closer we got to Ballintoy the poorer it became to the point it was raining slightly. However as we arrived in Ballintoy the sky started to clear and the sun threatened to shine. While Flo drove to the Giants Causeway and parked Blu, then got the bus back Lotti and I walked down to the Carrick-a-Rede bridge and enjoyed a Coffee in the sun outside the gift shop, watching tourists running from there tour buses to the rope bridge.</description>

Caught the Bus to Bloody Bridge (£2.00pp one way) and started walking, this time we found the easier path to the Quarry, once at the Quarry the going get slightly harder under foot until you reach the wall. Once at the wall the hard stuff begins this time I crossed the wall as under foot it was much better, nearing the top the wall has collapsed and boulders are strewn across the mountain so I crossed back over the wall and continued to the summit, to be joined by Flo about 30 mins later.</description>

      <description>We decided to have Easter here in Turis and travel to Cordoba on Easter Monday, when most of the Spanish traffic is heading home from Hols. This turned out to be a good decision as the volume of traffic on the other carriage way was considerable. We also had two good coffee stops which eased the trip. One stop was a place called Alacon an old fortified town over looking a river and Dam, our first coffe and cake of the trip the next stop was in a service station which was also very good with a great hunting shop.</description>

      <description>Flo Left 15 mins before me but I caught her too soon so we changed our coffee stop to El Dolcet in Montserrat. After the coffee we each headed off on own to finish the spin. This was the hottest day of our visit so far with the Garmin showing 31c , unfortunately the wind was savage but the down hill tail wind bits where brill. Flo done really well considering the wind and hills, following most of my route all but the cv-50.</description>

      <description>Nice ride through Chiva to Gestalgar quite hilly through a forest to Gestalgar which is nestled in a valley right at the foot of some big mountians. The road was closed, luckly there was a nice dirversion to Bugarra which seemed to be more a collection of factories, Pedralba on the other hand looks like it would be worth a visit on foot.
Today was once again very windy and I ended up with a cross head wind all the way home, and the roads where draggy and wide open no shelter.</description>

Requena for the Flat track which I heard about from Denis Noyes in the USA. A pretty low key meeting with none of the named riders turning up great track but poor racing on a bitterly cold windy day. It had rained over night which made the track very slippery until it started to dry.I reckon the guys from home would have cleaned up.</description>

Started off, having walked Lotti, with a beautiful blue sky, warm and little breeze at about 10:30am. Got to L’Alcudia and went off route (well, I did do it on the laptop without having been on the roads before !</description>

Once we got settled in I showered and shaved, then we took Lotti for a walk and looked for somewhere to eat no luck in that department so we drove up to the nearest super market bought some food and enjoyed our first outdoor meal.</description>

      <description>Last day and no Flo so Marty has free rain to do his worst, fortunately Marty was tired and I was able to keep up with out too much trouble, once again it was a good day cycling with a couple of big hills and two quick coffee stops.
We stayed close to the hotel tonight where we enjoyed a good meal at a good price.
All in all it was a great trip the cycling was good especially once we got up into the hills and away from the tourist areas, the apartment was excellent and over all the food good and at the right price.</description>

The two Flo&amp;rsquo;s went here for lunch while I went cycling. {{ more }} After a week in Wexford minding the Keane&amp;rsquo;s house we went to Cork. Naturally Wexford was easy going even with the poor weather, alough we did manage a cycle to Kilmore Quay where Flo finally got her Whippy.
Cork was more stressful got Flo Sr a Freezer plus a few jobs done around the house.</description>

A quick trial camping trip to Rostrevor just to see what we need and if it is feasible with Lotti.
All went ok except the tent is too small for our air bed and Lotti, so Flo is getting our larger tent back from Lynn. The only other thing we need to buy is a wind breaker.</description>

Arrived around 19:30 as the traffic was fairly heavy, but it was a nice bright day for a change.
Thursday we awoke to no internet access and even the stable diet in Wexford does not have wifi, spent a nice day with Kath and Frank before they all head off to Italy.
Friday the wind and rain woke us so we moved our planed cycle to Saturday and headed into Wexford where Flo spent a small fortune.</description>

We had to leave the car in to get an oil leek fixed, but I managed to offset this expense by fixing the heating myself.</description>

      <description>Didn&amp;rsquo;t get this month off to a good start, Flo was due back form Italy with her Mother on Saturday so I Drove down to Dublin to pick them up and then continued on to Cork.

All went well until I went to bed on Saturday night and I managed to catch my little toe on Lotti&amp;rsquo;s stool, sore wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even start to describe what I felt. A trip to Ards Casualty on the way home confirmed a broken toe.</description>

      <description>This is the first St Patricks day Parade I can ever remember going to, and where better than Cork for the first one. A big surprise for me was how multi cultural it was with most countries represented. A massive effort had been made by many to have the best floats with the Indian Yoga being on of the best.

This computer is probably the fastest that I have ever owned with an Intel® Core™ i7-4700MQ @ 2.40GHz processor and 12GB ram, it came with Windows 8 which I upgraded to 8.1 before I installed any software, and I also removed all the crapware, of which there was plenty.</description>

      <description>It has been a steep learning curve but I think it has been worth the effort, many of the problems with Jekyll have been a mixture of my ignorance and the devs breaking various parts of Jekyll. {{ more }}
I have a greater understanding of the mechanics of Jekyll and ruby gems, and I can at least remove and replace broken gems which is a big plus.
Git on the other hand still remains mostly a mystery I can just about do the most basic of things this will have to be address this coming year.</description>

Flo worked hard to produce a great spread of food, which was devoured along with several bottles of wine.
It was nice to be able to return the compliment for the Christmas dinners we have enjoyed at their house.
It was good catching up and finding out what Mark and Lisa where doing, both seem well on the way to careers of their own.</description>

      <description>Fogy and damp this morning but no wind to speak of and quite warm, so a good day to tackle the Greenway.
{{ more }} We rode from Achill to Newport via the Great Western Greenway ,easy going with only one steep section at Mullranny. The most interesting part is from Achill to Mullranny, with some nice views of the loughs. From Mullranny to Newport is very flat open moorland not the best when the wind is blowing.</description>

{{ more }}
Numbers where down on the usual mob that descends on Kirkistown, probably because this was a road course with hills and sharp corners. There where 3 groups on the road Ladies &amp;amp; over 50s, over 40s and senior riders with each group riding to win a club jersey in their respective class.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The race organisers have given in to the inevitable and the North West 200 road races have been abandoned.&amp;rdquo;
Most of the spectators had already given up and left their positions on the circuit.
The grandstand at the start/finish line is empty and there is a great sense of frustration here as we have managed just a couple of laps of action.
Five races were scheduled for today but only two circuits of the Supersport class were completed before that race was red flagged when a rider came off his bike at Church Corner.</description>

      <description>After a huge amount of fannying around Flo finally decided to to install a new rom on her HTC Wildfire, we followed the Instructions on this web site wiki.cyanogenmod.organd everything went fairly smoothly. The main reason she wanted to do this was the orignal rom was full of google apps which she didn&amp;rsquo;t use, and the phone was running out of space so she could not install Facebook, and google refuse to allow you to remove their apps.</description>

Back to the fracture clinic and I was seen by the Dr I was first seen by a few days after my accident and he was please with my progress, and in fact discharged me there and then, but not before I saw a Physo.</description>

{{ more }} I have lost 8lbs so far without too much trouble. The fasting days have become easier and drinking hot water when hungry helps , tea and coffee in moderation.
Cycling is better done on fast days and recovering or a light ride the next day, I have felt slightly week the day after a fast and exercise I need to find out if this is due to the fast or the exercise.</description>

      <description>On Friday 1st we started the Fast Diet (worst name ever) which involves fasting for two days a week.
The basics of the diet are that for two days a week you limit your calorie intake to 600 cals, split between breakfast and dinner, you can drink as much calorie free drink as you want. We chose Mon and Fri to start as we where travelling on these days and food was not readily available, we plan to fast on Mon and Thur from now on.</description>

Dropping her off at 9:35 without any breakfast did not go down well, after the initial meet and greet she would have happily come back home with us, however that wasn&amp;rsquo;t to be.

I have been hearing a strange noise from kzone, so I finally ran smartctl on it and to my horror discovered that all the drives where showing errors. I decided to replace the drive containing the OS straight away, which ment a trip to PC World for a new WD 500GB HD but coffee in Castle Espie was more inportant and being Sunday the shops hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet opened.</description>

      <description>This evening turned out to be quite busy, first I had an interview with Tesco in Newtownards and then more importantly Flo&amp;rsquo;s Birthday dinner at Daft Eddys.
The interview seemed to go well even though I had to wait for one of the interviewers. Needless to say I was declined a couple of weeks later.
The weather cleared up a little bit when we got to Daft Eddys and was very calm with a lovely sunset over the bay.</description>

      <description>Coffee and Grocery Shopping this morning then back home for Lunch. Flo fancied going to one of the television masts and view points but as soon as we left the house the mist came down and the wind got even stronger. When we got there, there where some guys painting the mast could not believe anyone would work in such poor and dangerous conditions
Having seen the waves from the mountain we decided to have a closer look, the wind was wild and the mist very low but the beach was great, and the wind surfers worth watching.</description>

      <description>The drive to Keem Beach was very hilly with great scenery, the beach it&amp;rsquo;s self was fantastic got some good shots of Lotti and flo. Luckily we had finished when a Coach load of tourists arrived so it was time to leave.
Drove round to the abandoned Village and then more Coffee where we watched some poor unfortunates trying to break into their car.
We walked to Alices Bar for some food and meet some Canadians from Novia Socia looking for directions, naturally we got soaked both ways heavy rain and strong winds but still quit mild.</description>

      <description>Need some supplies and coffee, The Village Bakery provided the first of many coffee stops and I wanted a look round the hardware store which turned out to be what we expected a mix of the old and new.
We drove to Newport and around Furnace lake and back to Achill for lunch. I thought we could walk lotti round the shore and back up a river on to the road but the beginning of the river proved illusive so we gave up and took Lotti back the way we came, leaving her in the house we walked back along the road to the top of the river and then followed it to the sea, not an easy walk good job we left Lotti home and of course the rain returned and we got soaked but it was good fun.</description>

      <description>John and Mairead came up from Cork to ride the hilly 125, the weather on the day was shite with heavy rain for the first hour and a half. No way would I have started if they hadn&amp;rsquo;t come up. It was warm which was about the best you could say, anyway I quite enjoyed the day.
After showers etc. we went to the Parlour at the Old Cross for tea, first time here and it was grand.</description>

Using the old reliable Cannondale I went for coffee in Bowbells and got soaked on the way there. Friday evening We meet up with the Perrys and McCoshes in Daft Eddys for a meal and some crac, we had a great night and the children where very well behaved.</description>

      <description>SENSE OF PLACE – Cruising in Cuba: The National Highway in Cuba has many stretches where you will not see another car for miles. Then when you do see one, it is an old classic like this 1950s Buick, which looks at home on the open road with the Cuban landscape of fields and mountains in the distance.

      <description>Time for the North Down GP, where do I start. Lots of talk in the days before the race, needless to say all a lot of hot air. Once again NDCC riders chasing each other down and even trying to knock each other off during the KOH Prem The head wind to D’dee helped keep a lid on the race as no one would ride in the wind, but tha tail wind on the Warren Rd made for a very fast run over Orlock , I Suppose the Finish line crash was more or less inevitable with riders dying and switching all over the place.</description>

      <description>I rode the Rás Loughguile today, the race started in lovely sunshine but we where soon meet with driving hail and when we went over Ora it snowed.I got away on the second lap when the first of the hail started and managed to stay away for a whole lap, I was nearly caught but the hail returned and the bunch eased off. On the Climb of Ora a smal group got away and because of the filthy conditions they managed to stay away to the finish, several crashes on the descent saw some riders face down in the bog.</description>

I also put new FSA compact bars on the Red Cannondale and my Felt, I have not been able to try the Felt yet but the Cannondale is fantastic, I can ride on the drops for long periods with out any problems, so I have ordered a set for the Fuji.
I had just finished all this when Flo complained about a clicking noise coming from the rear of Coppi, Further examination showed the rear wheel was nackered, hub and drive side cones gone, so I ordered a wheel from Chain Reaction, my next job when we get back from Cork on Monday.</description>

      <description>Easter Saturday was a lovely day and I enjoyed the club run to Portaferry, nice and fast on the way down helped by the brisk tail wind. On the way back everyone was quite relaxed with few changes if any, my legs where still stiff from Thursday so I opted not to go over the Brae.
Sunday and Monday where very unproductive with Paris Roubaix and then MotoGP both of which where compelling viewing, Boonen&amp;rsquo;s win in Roubaix was fantastic as was lorenzo&amp;rsquo;s in Qatar.</description>

      <description>St Patricks was on Sat so as it is a holiday down south John and Mairea where able to come up for the weekend. John and I managed to get out on our bikes every day as the weather was unseasonably good mild and dry.
On sat we rode the club run to Portaferry, I was caught short and stopped but I was unable to catch the group, luckily they stopped for coffee and I was able to join them for the rest of the ride.</description>

      <description>Started to get a feel for emacs to day, and it did take nearly all day. Finding information is not a problem finding current and relevant info can be a real challenge. How ever I did get the colour theme working and formatted the date in the calendar for European formatting. I even added the Moto GP and World Super Bike dates. Now all I have to do is put it all all together and start org mode.</description>

      <description>Spoke to Garth this afternoon, he was clearing out the Helena&amp;rsquo;s house in Birmingham, and had already made several trips to the dump. Sara had been round with a friend who bought the Cooker, Washing Machine and I think the Fridge. Garth already board managed a run as well. Hopefully he will be over Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.
Started to learn EMACS today worked through the basic manual and have made more progress than in the past, so far it has been relatively straight forward (I hope).</description>

      <description>As normal with Gentoo when things start to go wrong they just keep getting worse. First kdepy4 gave trouble had to downgrade sip, that sort of fixed that. Then kdepim4 wouldn&amp;rsquo;t compile, ended up leaving it, hopefully it will be fixed in the next few days. Must spend some time tidying up portage keywords etc.</description>

      <description>Spoke to Garth this after noon and he has book a Flight on Thursday to Heathrow arriving at 20:30 he will be staying in the Nova hotel and driving to Birmingham on Friday morning. Must ring him on Sat unless he get me first.
Did my Bowbell route this morning very windy once again but it turned out not as nasty as it could have been. Talked to Noel about the Rider Support Program and he was of the same opinion as myself, in that it was a bit elitist, and most of the club would not benefit from the program.</description>

      <description>Headed over to Dromara and on over Dree Hill today, not sure it was one of my better ideas. Dree Hill was as hard as usual I was even chased up by a hedge cutter, but we got there in the end, alough I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had enough to eat and I ran out of energy on the way home, a hard day as it was a head wind out and quite cold.</description>

      <description>Cleaned the Kitchen today, all the units on the outside,then the floor and cooker. Saved the inside of the cupboards for another day. Managed to break the light under the cupboard.
Then I spent the afternoon trying to copy Helena&amp;rsquo;s emails etc from Outlook, waiting for the outlook.ost file to download to see if it will run on my computer.
Once again the club email is screwing with me, changed the email from address to fausto and all hell broke loose, sorted with flo&amp;rsquo;s help then the mail was unreadable in fastmail, not sure if this was just a glitch in the space time continuum or or the character encoding was wrong so I altered the encoding.</description>

This afternoon I decided to try and install Pie Crust a web site generator,I think I have it working just need to discover how to create content. Of course before I could install Pie Crust I had to tidy up my test web sites so some where deleted, and I move Pie Crust &amp;amp; Chronicle to the virtual host directory on kzone.</description>

      <description>Rest day over and the legs felt slightly better, today is a long ride to Galway and the weather is damp to start with. Today turned out to be one of the best days riding yet, a nice cross tail wind warm and sunny. Once again the pace was fast for such a long day 138 miles.
Galway to Donegal Town via Sligo, where I finally lost patents with Noel who was continual going faster in heavy traffic, just too dangerous trying to keep up.</description>

Sunday started with heavy rain and strong cross winds, which soon turned into a strong head wind which was to be with us untill we reached Mizzen on Tuesday.</description>

      <description>Well, its the halfway point in the trip and time to reflect on the journey so far. When planning this trip my main concern was not the huge daily mileage but the weather and in particular the wind. My concern was justified as the strong winds played a role in our progress and morale&amp;hellip;.
An early start saw 5 riders leave from Ards Town Hall, battling south westerly winds, but by the end of the day, in Wicklow, we had lost 1 rider who returned the following morning by train.</description>

Some incidents to report &amp;hellip; 1stly Peter had a run in with a small dog but not noticed until too late, skilfully avoided. John did complete the entire day, was feeing better by the time he got to Blackrock - I think the heat assisted. From Blackrock to Wicklow Noel just took one wrong road and they ended up in Greystones - they tell me its a lovely town and was well worth the visit.</description>

      <description>The day started badly when updating kzone from my phone while still in bed, the job failed for no reason. After breakfast and much googling and one false start, I discovered that a backup job which ran during the night had copied files locally and filled the drive, after deleting them, all was back to normal. Getting sidetracked I was looking on the web when the monitor went dark. Out came the laptop and PC World had them in stock reserved one to collect and off we went to collect it, guess what, correct none in stock except display models, wasted journey.</description>

      <description>Road the Tour of the Glens today for the first time in about eight years. We had the best weather for many a year, except for the brutal 60 mile cross head wind all the way home. The wind was so strong that in places I could not take my hand off the bars to drink, and I was nearly blown off on the battery. Apart for the wind the ride was great with the hills not seeming as hard as I remembered, perhaps it was the blue sky and warm sunshine.</description>

      <description>With the weather remaining excellent for this time of year, we have got lots of things done. Thanks to Tim who supplied some manure , we where able to plant our Veg garden Broccoli, Carrots, Sweet Pea, Strawberries and Corvettes.
Easter Tue and it was the Club Easter Ramble to Newcastle, an over cast cool windy day and busy roads, 12 of us did the ride with lunch in Mauds. This was my second 100 miler this month, I thing the fact that the club where all in Mallorca doing big miles helped with the motivation and once again April is my highest mileage month so far.</description>

On arriving at Valentine Villas Hugh was no where to be found, after some searching we found him down at the Lough watching the world going by. He was in great form and as up to date with everything as usual .
The weather was great, cold but bright and sunny so I was able to get on the bike with John on Sunday and Tuesday , on Sunday we went with some local cyclists to Fermoy and Tuesday we went to Bandon &amp;amp; Kinsale, two good 50 plus mile runs.</description>

      <description>This month was a bit more eventful than last month. I started to get some serious miles in on the bike and I managed to get my first 100 miler of the year today (28th). However the weight loss is not going to plan so I will have to work on this.
On th 7th Amber Louise O&amp;rsquo;Brien was born so the following Sat we headed down to Dublin for the usual ooing and aahing, even got to see Barbra breast-feeding!</description>

      <description>Well this month was pretty uneventful, started to get some good miles in on the bike after a disastrous December. Dry but cold with little in the way of wind which is always good.
Noel called a meeting about the around Ireland challenge, Daren was there to offer advice on training and nutrition all things we know but choose to forget. I decided to try some long zone two rides both for endurance and weight loss, time will tell how that goes.</description>

      <description>After The Cooley Challenge we had promised John that we would go to Ballyhoura, after a dismal drive down in pouring rain on friday, Saturday turned out a lovely bright sunny day. 21 miles and two and a half hours later we had compleated the white run, lots of flowing single track on well maintained paths. Probably the best day I have ever had on a Mountain bike.</description>

      <description>On the 5th October we flew to Alicante and collected a battered hire for the drive to Valencia, as one would expect the weather was fabulous. The drive was uneventfull and we arrived at John &amp;amp; Mairead&amp;rsquo;s house mid after noon, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t take us long to get the wine on the go.

Happy 50th Birthday Flo
With glass in hand we enjoyed the weather for the rest of the day.</description>

Walls Of Derry
Week two and we found ourselves in the Everglades Hotel Londonderry, arriving quite late after a trip to Chain Reaction Cycles and a lovely lunch in the Galgorm Manor. Once we had checked in to the hotel Flo was busting a gut to explore the Walls of Derry, after finding a parking place off we set. Walking through a deserted town center past the Guild Hall we climb on to the walls, taking a anti-clockwise course we explored the walls.</description>

On arrival in Ballaghadereen and after checking in to the hotel we went out for a short drive to see what was available for food, but we decided to eat in the hotel bar.</description>

      <description>This year Flo rode the short course and finished 4th, not bad when you consider there was over 200 entries. John Preston came up from Cork and also rode the short course and finished 11th in his class, after his mate made him turn off this heart monitor.
I had a horrible day started off well enough riding to my heart rate on the long road section but once we went off road I started getting cramps which eventually forced me to cut the course and ride back via the road.</description>

      <description>Many weeks hard work by lots of club members paid off as this years event was one of the best yet. Superb weather saw close to 800 riders taking part. For the first time since we started running the event I was able to take photos at will, with most people happy to pose for me. The atmosphere at Barr Hall was great with everyone taking time to have lunch in the warm sunshine.</description>

      <description>April is traditionally a month of big mileage, or at least has been since our club started going to Mallorca for a weeks Cycling.
This year was no exception I managed almost 800 miles before our departure on Sat 24th, however I only managed one ride over 80 miles, the bulk being around 40 - 50 miles.
Suddenly all our training looked to have been in vain as a volcano erupted in Iceland and closed most of european air space for nearly a week, leaving many people stranded abroad and many loosing holidays completely, however our luck held and the wind changed direction blowing volcanic ash away, and so on the 24 our flight departed Belfast for Palma.</description>

Turning left we headed to the mourne wall and the valley between Donard and Commedagh. We then followed th Mourne Wall over Commedagh and Back to the Hare&amp;rsquo;s gap and finaly back to Meelmore Lodge, covering about 9.</description>

We drove down to Ballghadereen Co Roscommon on Friday night, the drive to Enniskillen was woeful due to road works but when we crosssed the border it turned into a lovely bright moon lite night.</description>

      <description>First Cross event in a couple of years, super course but much too hard for the first event of the year. The course was more suited to mountain bikes than CX bikes with quite a severe down hill section with large rocks to be avoided. All of the course was ridable , but I was a bit over geared for some of the climbs. Four 3 mile laps with 2 severe climbs made this a tough event.</description>

      <description>We decided to go for a walk today, and after great debate I decided on Murlough Bay just outside Dundrum. So off we set just after 10:00 rather later than I would have like, but that&amp;rsquo;s the price of indecision. Arrived in the car park just before 11:00 and off we set.

Well what a surprise as we set off through the sand dunes, a board walk lead us to the beach, and fantastic views of the Mourne Mountains towering over Newcastle.</description>

I spent the rest of the week looking for an excuse not to go but no really good one came to mind so on Friday I found myself checking over the BeOne for the adventure to follow.</description>
