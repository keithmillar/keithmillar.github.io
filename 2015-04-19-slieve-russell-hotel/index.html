<p>Slieve Russell Hotel near Cavan was our destination for a short break that we have been promising ourselves for quite some time. After taking Lotti to jail and when Flo got back from her cycle we set off, stopping in Augher Station House for coffee.

<p>We had Dinner in the  Setanta Restaurant and apart from the Maître D (who, when we booked was having a problem fitting two in!!!) we had a lovely meal which was complemented by a nice bottle of Keenan’s Bridge Cabernet Shiraz (on May &amp; Carole)</p>

<p>On the way home we stopped at Oxford Island and spent some time watching Great Crested Grebes displaying, just topped off a great weekend.</p>
