<p>Office / Guest room we decided to install the orignal kitchen window which was
too big for the kitchen, in order to do that we removed the Lintel and bought
a longer 150cm lintel. Enlarging the window apature was very messy fine dust
every where couldn&rsquo;t even see to use the cutter, anyway some brick work and
a few doggy moments getting the lintel into place and the window in and glued
in with a mix of expanding foam a cement</p>
<p>Also put a roof on the Pump House.</p>
<p>Took Lotti to the vet and got blood work done which pointed to anemia and low liver function on loads of drugs. Lotti kept us up all night seemed in pain, more likley a reaction to her meds lots of morphine.</p>
<p>Flo got her first covid jab.</p>
<p>Lotti Sleepless Night. Yesterday Lotti started her second IV, but early evening a massive explosion of poo and pee, she then became agitated and we could not get any more fluid in to her. Eventually around 01:00 she went to sleep and we where able to continue with the IV.</p>
<p>30th Tuff day for Lotti, her iv stopped working which entailed a visit to the vet. Pedro couldn&rsquo;t get a new iv in as her vein collapsed, luckily he was able to fix the old iv, however he did think lotti&rsquo;s condition was deteriorating. At home she became very agitated until we put her to bed where she settled and spent a relatively comfortable night.</p>
