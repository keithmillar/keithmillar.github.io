<p>I have had my <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/uk/en/">Lenovo</a> for nearly a month now and I am very pleased with it. It is much larger than my previous Sony CS1.
{{ more }}</p>
<p>This computer is probably the fastest that I have ever owned with an Intel® Core™ i7-4700MQ @ 2.40GHz processor and 12GB ram, it came with Windows 8 which I upgraded to 8.1 before I installed any software, and I also removed all the crapware, of which there was plenty. The keyboard in nice to use but the trackpad is a disaster with the buttons integrated into the pad and it is offset left of center which is just wrong.</p>
<p>The screen is ok with colors slightly muted hopefully this won&rsquo;t have a negative impact when using Lightroom or watching video.</p>
<p>The main reason for the purchase is to run Virtual Machines to test different OS and software/configurations. So far it has not disappointed, I have installed <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> (Jessie/testing) and <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> both run as if fully installed, I gave both machines 4GB ram, <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> got 4 cores to help with compiling while <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> got 2 both run well, in fact the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> machine run faster than the kzone server.</p>
