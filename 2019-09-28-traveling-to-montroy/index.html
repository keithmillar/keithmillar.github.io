<p>Nice easy drive to Dublin, stopping once for fuel and a burger. Arrived Dublin port 14:27 W.B.Yates sailed 30 mins late 16:30 So far crossings ok may get rough later.</p>
<p><strong>2019-09-29 Cherbourg  - Verteuil-sur-Charente.</strong></p>
<p>Restless night and a rough crossing but still better than flying. Due to dock about midday but we&rsquo;ve just been told there is a delay to 13:30 cet. Boat docked at 13:30 wet and very windy here on our way now getting blown all over the road. Stopped in a place called Perry for a crossant. Stopped in Rennes eating a McDonald&rsquo;s 20c long drive ahead don&rsquo;t think we will get as far as hoped. Stopped late tonight in Verteuil-sur-Charente and Aire de Loisirs Des 3 Vallees Site no 189</p>
<p><strong>2019-09-30 Verteuil-sur-Charente - Huesca.</strong></p>
<p>A good night&rsquo;s sleep until the bin men awakened us at 05:00 but got back to sleep. Still still very overcast and damp this morning but a nice place to walk Lotti. Drove about 3 hrs and stopped for coffee by the river in la Fleix 23c very nice place. Once we got to Pau we decided to continue on to Huesca via the Col Del Portalet arrived in the aire 20:30 most enjoyable drive over the Pyrenees in beautiful evening sunshine.</p>

<p><strong>2019-10-01 Huesca - Montroy.</strong></p>
<p>Left the aire in Huesca at 10:00 and emeditaly spotted fuel at a good price so naturally we filled up. Then hit the road properly for the final push to Montroy. We stopped about 11:45 for a coffee and once again for lunch. We then decided to stop at Lidlington for some necessities, it was here that we realised how hot it was 36c on Eddys gauge.</p>
<p>Finally we arrived around 17:00 and spent the next couple of hours unpacking Eddy, not a lot has changed,  the garden needs help.</p>
