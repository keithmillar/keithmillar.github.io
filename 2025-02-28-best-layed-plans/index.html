<p>Late on Thursday 10th we went up to Shirley &amp; Mario&rsquo;s to look after the dogs until Monday 10th,
We got Wood delivered from a place just outside the town a bit expensive worth it as in burns hotter and longer. Done some niggle jobs like the handle on the bathroom door and the pavers levelled and glued.</p>
<p>Pissed about the car needing fuel the fuel tank drained and cleaned 300â‚¬ causing me to miss a cycle near Gandia, although I heard later that it was cancelled due to heavy rain and cold.</p>
<p>Flo&rsquo;s sprocket wasn&rsquo;t ordered and the gravel bike wouldn&rsquo;t be available until June so we decided it would better to sell the Urrun and get something more appropriate looks like she has settled on a BH. Heading off on Friday for a weekend near Barcelona before we collect G&amp;H.</p>
