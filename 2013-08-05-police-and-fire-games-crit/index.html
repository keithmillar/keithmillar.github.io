<p>To night could not have been more different than last Wednesday nights Time Trial, bright blue sky and light winds, ideal conditions for racing.</p>

<p>Four races where on the cards, Woman and over 70s, over 50s, over 40s, and up to 39. We had two riders in the over 50s class John Hunter and Noel Boyce, Noel went on to win his third gold. Michael Mcmullan riding in the over 40s was riding well but was unfortunate to puncture and unable to finish. Lewis Ferguson riding in the 18-40 had a good race to finish second to Damien Shaw and pick up his second medal.</p>
