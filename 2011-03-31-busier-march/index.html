<p>March saw a trip to Cork to visit Flo&rsquo;s uncle Hugh, who had just had a pacemaker fitted. On arriving at Valentine Villas Hugh was no where to be found, after some searching we found him down at the Lough watching the world going by. He was in great form and as up to date with everything as usual .</p>
<p>The weather was great, cold but bright and sunny so I was able to get on the bike with John on Sunday and Tuesday , on Sunday we went with some local cyclists to Fermoy and Tuesday we went to Bandon &amp; Kinsale, two good 50 plus mile runs.</p>
<p>Managed to get just over 1000 miles in this month, just as well as our Ireland trip is getting closer, will have to try harder next month to keep this up.</p>
