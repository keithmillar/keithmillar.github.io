      <description>Garth arrived on 18th at 05:30 and with him came the first snow of the year and freezing temperatures. After Breakfast in the travelodge it was of to Maria&amp;rsquo;s to get the dart into Dublin.
Off the DART and a cold busy Dublin awaited us. A quick walk around the city centre with a visit to HMV and the Post Office on O&amp;rsquo;Connell Street, which was pretty much the original building.</description>

      <description>Drove up on friday afternoon traffic was light, which gave us time to admire the sunset. Fantastic as it was it was a precursor to the wild weather forecast for late Friday night and Saturday.
Arrived at the Magherabuoy House Hotel around 16:30 and relaxed in our rooms, then went for a drink in the bar and our comp meal in the hotel restaurant. An early night ready for tomorrow.</description>

      <title>East Antrim Cyclo Cross</title>

      <description>First Cross event in a couple of years, super course but much too hard for the first event of the year. The course was more suited to mountain bikes than CX bikes with quite a severe down hill section with large rocks to be avoided. All of the course was ridable , but I was a bit over geared for some of the climbs. Four 3 mile laps with 2 severe climbs made this a tough event.</description>

      <description>We decided to go for a walk today, and after great debate I decided on Murlough Bay just outside Dundrum. So off we set just after 10:00 rather later than I would have like, but that&amp;rsquo;s the price of indecision. Arrived in the car park just before 11:00 and off we set.
Murloch
Well what a surprise as we set off through the sand dunes, a board walk lead us to the beach, and fantastic views of the Mourne Mountains towering over Newcastle.</description>

      <description>Having stumbled across this event on the web, I thought I would mention it to Marty, big mistake &amp;ldquo;always wanted to do one of those&amp;rdquo;Â was his immediate reaction and that was it we were now fully committed. I spent the rest of the week looking for an excuse not to go but no really good one came to mind so on Friday I found myself checking over the BeOne for the adventure to follow.</description>

      <description>Arrive early so we went for a coffee, then panicked when we look up the hill and saw that there was already loads of people on the climb. Struggled up the hill and got a really good spot on the left about three quarters of the way up.

      <description>Rode the Dromara Hilly 125 today after much debate, woke to pleasant morning so I had no more excuses. Not having made any travel arrangements with the club I drove down on my own and was pleased that Eric, Ian, Trevor, Noel, Harry and the Old Pro (Brian) had also made the trip, content now that I would have some good wheels to sit on I started looking forward to the days ride.</description>
