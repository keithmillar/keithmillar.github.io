      <description>Finally after much procrastinating we got round to having John and Fiona over for a meal.

Flo worked hard to produce a great spread of food, which was devoured along with several bottles of wine.
It was nice to be able to return the compliment for the Christmas dinners we have enjoyed at their house.
It was good catching up and finding out what Mark and Lisa where doing, both seem well on the way to careers of their own.</description>

      <description>Tropical temperatures once again today 22c can&amp;rsquo;t believe it at this time of year. A furley steep start the walk but once we reached the cliff edge the walking was much easier.
{{ more }} We walked from Keem beach up along the cliffs and back down through the valley about 4 miles inall, and once a fantastic day. Looking out over the Atlantic the views where spectacular.

      <description>Near perfect conditions for our bike ride today little wind and very warm. The ride turned out to be a lot easier than I thought.
{{ more }} Hard to believe shorts no arm warmers at the end of Sept and it was 21c at one time. We decided not to go to Keel as it is all on the main road. Luckily the route brought us to the coffee shop where we watched the world go by.</description>

      <description>After yesterdays exertions we decided to have an easy day today, and it was a bit windy to cycle.
{{ more }} So after a late breakfast and a walk with Lotti, we drove to Achill and reacquainted our selves with home bakery, and yet again it came up trumphs.
A quick walk round the local shops and then a spin to Keel to see where the wind surfing would be held.</description>

      <description>Fogy and damp this morning but no wind to speak of and quite warm, so a good day to tackle the Greenway.
{{ more }} We rode from Achill to Newport via the Great Western Greenway ,easy going with only one steep section at Mullranny. The most interesting part is from Achill to Mullranny, with some nice views of the loughs. From Mullranny to Newport is very flat open moorland not the best when the wind is blowing.</description>

Quite a few of the Club where going to Downpatrick so I joined them in Ards and we took the quite back roads to the start at Downpatrick race course, with Flo driving down and getting an early start on her own with the intention of me catching her later.</description>

      <description>The now annual wedding took place in Lough Rea this weekend. Being near Galway meant a long journey for Flo and myself, nearly 5 hours in total, at least the roads have improved and the trip wasn&amp;rsquo;t as arduous as it may have been.</description>

      <description>Almost perfect conditions tonight for the road race light winds warm and dry. This has to be one of the best marshalled club events I have ever been at thanks in part to the Peninsula Tri club.
{{ more }}
Numbers where down on the usual mob that descends on Kirkistown, probably because this was a road course with hills and sharp corners. There where 3 groups on the road Ladies &amp;amp; over 50s, over 40s and senior riders with each group riding to win a club jersey in their respective class.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s it good for? The default key binding for K (that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;shift-k&amp;rdquo; I guess) in vim is to look up the word under the cursor using the man command. The sad thing about this process is that vim gets replaced by less (or whatever pager you happen to be using), and that once you&amp;rsquo;re done reading the page, you have to press &amp;ldquo;Enter&amp;rdquo; one additional time to get back into vim and back to whatever you were doing.</description>

      <description>We went for a drive this morning with the intention of stopping at the river Quoile near Downpatrick for a small picnic, but when we got there it was very quite so we decided to continue on to Saint Patricks Rd where there is a Monument to St Patrick.

We watched some heavy showers crossing the country and headed off for our picnic.

I thought that there was a car park near Strangford with good views of the lough, after some searching we found Cloughy Rocks a very small nature reserve with good views over Strangford Lough where we saw loads of seals basking on the rocks in the warm sunshine.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The race organisers have given in to the inevitable and the North West 200 road races have been abandoned.&amp;rdquo;
Most of the spectators had already given up and left their positions on the circuit.
The grandstand at the start/finish line is empty and there is a great sense of frustration here as we have managed just a couple of laps of action.
Five races were scheduled for today but only two circuits of the Supersport class were completed before that race was red flagged when a rider came off his bike at Church Corner.</description>

      <description>After a huge amount of fannying around Flo finally decided to to install a new rom on her HTC Wildfire, we followed the Instructions on this web site wiki.cyanogenmod.org and everything went fairly smoothly. The main reason she wanted to do this was the orignal rom was full of google apps which she didn&amp;rsquo;t use, and the phone was running out of space so she could not install Facebook, and google refuse to allow you to remove their apps.</description>

{{ more }}
The basics of the diet are that for two days a week you limit your calorie intake to 600 cals, split between breakfast and dinner, you can drink as much calorie free drink as you want. We chose Mon and Fri to start as we where travelling on these days and food was not readily available, we plan to fast on Mon and Thur from now on.</description>

So Flo and I went back to bed, well Flo did I did some things on the computer related to this blog, oh yes just rembered I changed the YAML front matter to suit the Jekyll blog software that I intend to use. Then we dandered down the town and had coffee. The rest of the day I think we lazed around and watched TV.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Started off the day in the garden raking up leaves, and then we cut back the honeysuckle and found a fancy mushroom growing under the bush.
I have been hearing a strange noise from kzone, so I finally ran smartctl on it and to my horror discovered that all the drives where showing errors. I decided to replace the drive containing the OS straight away, which ment a trip to PC World for a new WD 500GB HD but coffee in Castle Espie was more inportant and being Sunday the shops hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet opened.</description>

      <description>This evening turned out to be quite busy, first I had an interview with Tesco in Newtownards and then more importantly Flo&amp;rsquo;s Birthday dinner at Daft Eddys.
The interview seemed to go well even though I had to wait for one of the interviewers. Needless to say I was declined a couple of weeks later.
The weather cleared up a little bit when we got to Daft Eddys and was very calm with a lovely sunset over the bay.</description>

      <description>Coffee and Grocery Shopping this morning then back home for Lunch. Flo fancied going to one of the television masts and view points but as soon as we left the house the mist came down and the wind got even stronger. When we got there, there where some guys painting the mast could not believe anyone would work in such poor and dangerous conditions
Having seen the waves from the mountain we decided to have a closer look, the wind was wild and the mist very low but the beach was great, and the wind surfers worth watching.</description>

      <description>The drive to Keem Beach was very hilly with great scenery, the beach it&amp;rsquo;s self was fantastic got some good shots of Lotti and flo. Luckily we had finished when a Coach load of tourists arrived so it was time to leave.
Drove round to the abandoned Village and then more Coffee where we watched some poor unfortunates trying to break into their car.
We walked to Alices Bar for some food and meet some Canadians from Novia Socia looking for directions, naturally we got soaked both ways heavy rain and strong winds but still quit mild.</description>

      <description>Need some supplies and coffee, The Village Bakery provided the first of many coffee stops and I wanted a look round the hardware store which turned out to be what we expected a mix of the old and new.
We drove to Newport and around Furnace lake and back to Achill for lunch. I thought we could walk lotti round the shore and back up a river on to the road but the beginning of the river proved illusive so we gave up and took Lotti back the way we came, leaving her in the house we walked back along the road to the top of the river and then followed it to the sea, not an easy walk good job we left Lotti home and of course the rain returned and we got soaked but it was good fun.</description>

No way would I have started if they hadn&amp;rsquo;t come up. It was warm which was about the best you could say, anyway I quite enjoyed the day.
After showers etc. we went to the Parlour at the Old Cross for tea, first time here and it was grand.</description>

      <description>SENSE OF PLACE – Cruising in Cuba: The National Highway in Cuba has many stretches where you will not see another car for miles. Then when you do see one, it is an old classic like this 1950s Buick, which looks at home on the open road with the Cuban landscape of fields and mountains in the distance.

Next morning we visited Oakdene met with the Kearneys and Flo’s mum then to Cork for some Shopping. I go a Nice Cycling top and Flo bought some ecco shoes we also got a Sony USB dvd drive .</description>

      <description>I find it a bit annoying that I have to re-enter my password twice every time I (re-)start mutt when I want to update my configuration file. Well, it appears I don&amp;rsquo;t need to be doing restarting mutt. The MuttWiki describes a way to re-load the configuration after mutt is running. Type the following into mutt after you&amp;rsquo;ve changed your muttrc file:  :source /path/to/your/muttrc Note that shell expansions may not work&amp;mdash;you should spell out the full path.</description>

On Sunday Flo and I went out for a spin to Daft Eddys, it was a lovely day but Flo was a bit sick so we had to cut the run short.</description>

      <description>Time for the North Down GP, where do I start. Lots of talk in the days before the race, needless to say all a lot of hot air. Once again NDCC riders chasing each other down and even trying to knock each other off during the KOH Prem The head wind to D’dee helped keep a lid on the race as no one would ride in the wind, but tha tail wind on the Warren Rd made for a very fast run over Orlock , I Suppose the Finish line crash was more or less inevitable with riders dying and switching all over the place.</description>

      <description>I rode the Rás Loughguile today, the race started in lovely sunshine but we where soon meet with driving hail and when we went over Ora it snowed.I got away on the second lap when the first of the hail started and managed to stay away for a whole lap, I was nearly caught but the hail returned and the bunch eased off. On the Climb of Ora a smal group got away and because of the filthy conditions they managed to stay away to the finish, several crashes on the descent saw some riders face down in the bog.</description>

      <description>Fitted new forks, brakes &amp;amp; cables and a front mech to the Fuji. I also put new FSA compact bars on the Red Cannondale and my Felt, I have not been able to try the Felt yet but the Cannondale is fantastic, I can ride on the drops for long periods with out any problems, so I have ordered a set for the Fuji.
I had just finished all this when Flo complained about a clicking noise coming from the rear of Coppi, Further examination showed the rear wheel was nackered, hub and drive side cones gone, so I ordered a wheel from Chain Reaction, my next job when we get back from Cork on Monday.</description>

      <description>Easter Saturday was a lovely day and I enjoyed the club run to Portaferry, nice and fast on the way down helped by the brisk tail wind. On the way back everyone was quite relaxed with few changes if any, my legs where still stiff from Thursday so I opted not to go over the Brae.
Sunday and Monday where very unproductive with Paris Roubaix and then MotoGP both of which where compelling viewing, Boonen&amp;rsquo;s win in Roubaix was fantastic as was lorenzo&amp;rsquo;s in Qatar.</description>

On sat we rode the club run to Portaferry, I was caught short and stopped but I was unable to catch the group, luckily they stopped for coffee and I was able to join them for the rest of the ride.</description>

      <description>While reading gmane.emacs.help I came accross this post where somebody asked how he could make a portable app out of Emacs&amp;rsquo; Windows version.
So since I&amp;rsquo;m still at my internship (where they use Windows) and just recently obtained an iAudio X5L portable media player which behaves like an USB2 harddisk to the OS I wondered if I could manage to make Emacs portable.
Short version: I could, the &amp;ldquo;hardest&amp;rdquo; part was in fact not even Emacs related, but my sheer lack of knowledge about Windows batch script.</description>

How ever I did get the colour theme working and formatted the date in the calendar for European formatting. I even added the Moto GP and World Super Bike dates. Now all I have to do is put it all all together and start org mode.</description>

      <description>Spoke to Garth this afternoon, he was clearing out the Helena&amp;rsquo;s house in Birmingham, and had already made several trips to the dump. Sara had been round with a friend who bought the Cooker, Washing Machine and I think the Fridge. Garth already board managed a run as well. Hopefully he will be over Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.
Started to learn EMACS today worked through the basic manual and have made more progress than in the past, so far it has been relatively straight forward (I hope).</description>

      <description>As normal with Gentoo when things start to go wrong they just keep getting worse. First kdepy4 gave trouble had to downgrade sip, that sort of fixed that. Then kdepim4 wouldn&amp;rsquo;t compile, ended up leaving it, hopefully it will be fixed in the next few days. Must spend some time tidying up portage keywords etc.</description>

Did my Bowbell route this morning very windy once again but it turned out not as nasty as it could have been. Talked to Noel about the Rider Support Program and he was of the same opinion as myself, in that it was a bit elitist, and most of the club would not benefit from the program.</description>

Dree Hill was as hard as usual I was even chased up by a hedge cutter, but we got there in the end, alough I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had enough to eat and I ran out of energy on the way home, a hard day as it was a head wind out and quite cold.</description>

      <description>Updated the members services section of the website today, as normal ended up doing it twice first time to prove that I did&amp;rsquo;nt like what I had and then to improve on that.
For what ever reason I thought I would try and get a script to upload this blog to fastmail using NCFTPP found a nice wee bash script then spent several hours trying to get it working, eventually success and it seemed to work well.</description>

      <description>emerge -P gentoo-sources to remove oldest kernel before installing latest kernel
In most cases, temporary files used during compilation will still remain under the appropriate source directory under /usr/src. It is safe to remove these using rm.
You can also safely delete any modules that were used by this kernel. This can be done by removing the appropriate directories under /lib/modules/ that relate to the kernel versions you are removing. Be careful not to delete modules belonging to kernels that you still use!</description>

      <description>Cleaned the Kitchen today, all the units on the outside,then the floor and cooker. Saved the inside of the cupboards for another day. Managed to break the light under the cupboard.
Then I spent the afternoon trying to copy Helena&amp;rsquo;s emails etc from Outlook, waiting for the outlook.ost file to download to see if it will run on my computer.
Once again the club email is screwing with me, changed the email from address to fausto and all hell broke loose, sorted with flo&amp;rsquo;s help then the mail was unreadable in fastmail, not sure if this was just a glitch in the space time continuum or or the character encoding was wrong so I altered the encoding.</description>

      <description>Started today off with a nice cycle and of course Coffee in Mountstewart, weather for once was quite nice but cold, dry roads for the first time in what seems like weeks.
This afternoon I decided to try and install Pie Crust a web site generator,I think I have it working just need to discover how to create content. Of course before I could install Pie Crust I had to tidy up my test web sites so some where deleted, and I move Pie Crust &amp;amp; Chronicle to the virtual host directory on kzone.</description>

      <description>First we went to Thunder Hole then a 4 mile walk in ANC. Lovely warm day blue sky, very hard walking nearly vertical in places more of a scramble. Passed an elderly couple who were having a hard time, little did they know worse was to come. When we returned to the car park we spoke to the range and informed her about them just in case they got into difficulty.</description>

      <description>Rest day over and the legs felt slightly better, today is a long ride to Galway and the weather is damp to start with. Today turned out to be one of the best days riding yet, a nice cross tail wind warm and sunny. Once again the pace was fast for such a long day 138 miles.
Galway to Donegal Town via Sligo, where I finally lost patents with Noel who was continual going faster in heavy traffic, just too dangerous trying to keep up.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we reached the half way point of our trip, and a hard old slogg it&amp;rsquo;s been. Saturday was the longest day with busy roads and some showers early on, I could have easily stopped there and then it was just a horrible day, But we Finely reached Wicklow.
Sunday started with heavy rain and strong cross winds, which soon turned into a strong head wind which was to be with us untill we reached Mizzen on Tuesday.</description>

      <description>The day started badly when updating kzone from my phone while still in bed, the job failed for no reason. After breakfast and much googling and one false start, I discovered that a backup job which ran during the night had copied files locally and filled the drive, after deleting them, all was back to normal. Getting sidetracked I was looking on the web when the monitor went dark. Out came the laptop and PC World had them in stock reserved one to collect and off we went to collect it, guess what, correct none in stock except display models, wasted journey.</description>

      <description>Road the Tour of the Glens today for the first time in about eight years. We had the best weather for many a year, except for the brutal 60 mile cross head wind all the way home. The wind was so strong that in places I could not take my hand off the bars to drink, and I was nearly blown off on the battery. Apart for the wind the ride was great with the hills not seeming as hard as I remembered, perhaps it was the blue sky and warm sunshine.</description>

      <description>With the weather remaining excellent for this time of year, we have got lots of things done. Thanks to Tim who supplied some manure , we where able to plant our Veg garden Broccoli, Carrots, Sweet Pea, Strawberries and Corvettes.
Easter Tue and it was the Club Easter Ramble to Newcastle, an over cast cool windy day and busy roads, 12 of us did the ride with lunch in Mauds. This was my second 100 miler this month, I thing the fact that the club where all in Mallorca doing big miles helped with the motivation and once again April is my highest mileage month so far.</description>

On arriving at Valentine Villas Hugh was no where to be found, after some searching we found him down at the Lough watching the world going by. He was in great form and as up to date with everything as usual .
The weather was great, cold but bright and sunny so I was able to get on the bike with John on Sunday and Tuesday , on Sunday we went with some local cyclists to Fermoy and Tuesday we went to Bandon &amp;amp; Kinsale, two good 50 plus mile runs.</description>

      <description>This month was a bit more eventful than last month. I started to get some serious miles in on the bike and I managed to get my first 100 miler of the year today (28th). However the weight loss is not going to plan so I will have to work on this.
On th 7th Amber Louise O&amp;rsquo;Brien was born so the following Sat we headed down to Dublin for the usual ooing and aahing, even got to see Barbra breast-feeding!</description>

      <description>Well this month was pretty uneventful, started to get some good miles in on the bike after a disastrous December. Dry but cold with little in the way of wind which is always good.
Noel called a meeting about the around Ireland challenge, Daren was there to offer advice on training and nutrition all things we know but choose to forget. I decided to try some long zone two rides both for endurance and weight loss, time will tell how that goes.</description>

Once again the whole family put on a great spread of food and drink and a great day was had by all. It was good to see Kathleen, Fiona, Mark and Lisa once again.</description>

      <description>After The Cooley Challenge we had promised John that we would go to Ballyhoura, after a dismal drive down in pouring rain on friday, Saturday turned out a lovely bright sunny day. 21 miles and two and a half hours later we had compleated the white run, lots of flowing single track on well maintained paths. Probably the best day I have ever had on a Mountain bike.</description>

The drive was uneventfull and we arrived at John &amp;amp; Mairead&amp;rsquo;s house mid after noon, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t take us long to get the wine on the go.

Walls Of Derry
Week two and we found ourselves in the Everglades Hotel Londonderry, arriving quite late after a trip to Chain Reaction Cycles and a lovely lunch in the Galgorm Manor. Once we had checked in to the hotel Flo was busting a gut to explore the Walls of Derry, after finding a parking place off we set. Walking through a deserted town center past the Guild Hall we climb on to the walls, taking a anti-clockwise course we explored the walls.</description>

On arrival in Ballaghadereen and after checking in to the hotel we went out for a short drive to see what was available for food, but we decided to eat in the hotel bar.</description>

      <description>This year Flo rode the short course and finished 4th, not bad when you consider there was over 200 entries. John Preston came up from Cork and also rode the short course and finished 11th in his class, after his mate made him turn off this heart monitor.
I had a horrible day started off well enough riding to my heart rate on the long road section but once we went off road I started getting cramps which eventually forced me to cut the course and ride back via the road.</description>

For the first time since we started running the event I was able to take photos at will, with most people happy to pose for me. The atmosphere at Barr Hall was great with everyone taking time to have lunch in the warm sunshine.</description>

      <description>April is traditionally a month of big mileage, or at least has been since our club started going to Mallorca for a weeks Cycling.
This year was no exception I managed almost 800 miles before our departure on Sat 24th, however I only managed one ride over 80 miles, the bulk being around 40 - 50 miles.
Suddenly all our training looked to have been in vain as a volcano erupted in Iceland and closed most of european air space for nearly a week, leaving many people stranded abroad and many loosing holidays completely, however our luck held and the wind changed direction blowing volcanic ash away, and so on the 24 our flight departed Belfast for Palma.</description>

Turning left we headed to the mourne wall and the valley between Donard and Commedagh. We then followed th Mourne Wall over Commedagh and Back to the Hare&amp;rsquo;s gap and finaly back to Meelmore Lodge, covering about 9.</description>

      <description>First Cross event in a couple of years, super course but much too hard for the first event of the year. The course was more suited to mountain bikes than CX bikes with quite a severe down hill section with large rocks to be avoided. All of the course was ridable , but I was a bit over geared for some of the climbs. Four 3 mile laps with 2 severe climbs made this a tough event.</description>

      <description>We decided to go for a walk today, and after great debate I decided on Murlough Bay just outside Dundrum. So off we set just after 10:00 rather later than I would have like, but that&amp;rsquo;s the price of indecision. Arrived in the car park just before 11:00 and off we set.

Well what a surprise as we set off through the sand dunes, a board walk lead us to the beach, and fantastic views of the Mourne Mountains towering over Newcastle.</description>

      <description>Arrive early so we went for a coffee, then panicked when we look up the hill and saw that there was already loads of people on the climb. Struggled up the hill and got a really good spot on the left about three quarters of the way up.

      <description>Rode the Dromara Hilly 125 today after much debate, woke to pleasant morning so I had no more excuses. Not having made any travel arrangements with the club I drove down on my own and was pleased that Eric, Ian, Trevor, Noel, Harry and the Old Pro (Brian) had also made the trip, content now that I would have some good wheels to sit on I started looking forward to the days ride.</description>
