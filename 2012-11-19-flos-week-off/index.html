<p>After Flo had to cancle her second weeks holiday when she hurt her back she booked this week off.
Monday and we went to the new James Bond film Skyfall which was very good and we got the cinema almost to our selves.</p>

<p>Wednesday we both went out on our bikes and I meet up with Flo in Bowbell and we came back with the club.
Thursday we went into Belfast for lunch and a look around town. The town was very quite which suited me fine, Flo took me to Murial&rsquo;s for lunch which was nice. Great to see Belfast becoming a proper city with tourests and people doing normal things.
Sunday and Judy was up for the Irish Experts Trial which was cancled so we went to the Parlour for a meal.</p>
