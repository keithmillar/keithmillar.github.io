<p>Arrived around 19:30 as the traffic was fairly heavy, but it was a nice bright
day for a change.</p>
<p>Thursday we awoke to no internet access and even the stable diet in Wexford
does not have wifi, spent a nice day with Kath and Frank before they all head
off to Italy.</p>
<p>Friday the wind and rain woke us so we moved our planed cycle to Saturday and
headed into Wexford where Flo spent a small fortune. Found internet in Kellys coffee
shop but luckily when we got home the internet had been restored.</p>
<p>Saturday and more gale force wind so no cycling once again, but we walked to
Rosslare via the Cliff walk and watched a ferry docking.</p>
<p>Sunday finally the wind dropped and our cycle was on. La Ruta del Murrintowneo
a 100 km charity cycle to the Hook lighthouse and back, turned out a great day
warm with some sunny spells. Stayed in the front group all day 88 miles (rode
from the house and back) Flo done the 100km as well with no bother.</p>

<p>Monday winds back so we walked the cliff walk again so Flo could get it on her
Garmin. Then we went to Kayroo where we had a disappointing Coffee and Scone.
Car developed a engine fault planning what to do.</p>
<p>Tuesday still windy but went for a cycle anyway. Turned out wind wasn&rsquo;t so bad
and we had a nice run. Took the car to the local dealer and they turned of the
warning light.</p>
<p>Wednesday After coffee in Stable Diet we drove home, all seemed ok with the
car. Good trip great views of the ISS.</p>
