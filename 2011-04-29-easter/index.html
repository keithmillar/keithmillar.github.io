<p>With the weather remaining excellent for this time of year, we have got lots of things done. Thanks to Tim who supplied some manure , we where able to plant our Veg garden Broccoli, Carrots, Sweet Pea, Strawberries and Corvettes.</p>
<p>Easter Tue and it was the Club Easter Ramble to Newcastle, an over cast cool windy day and busy roads, 12 of us did the ride with lunch in Mauds. This was my second 100 miler this month, I thing the fact that the club where all in Mallorca doing big miles helped with the motivation and once again April is my highest mileage month so far.</p>
<p>With all the dry weather I have had another high mileage month, which is good as there is just 4 weeks until the Ireland Tour, I will have to think about how to taper for the week before we start.</p>
<p>Colin Bev and Jazmin came for tea on Saturday had a great night and we watched the Magic Roundabout.</p>
<p>Just getting read to head off to Greyabbey and Hoops with Flo for some Royal Wedding coffee.</p>
