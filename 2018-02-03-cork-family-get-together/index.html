<p>Got Lotti into jail and on the road by 10:00 which gave us a clear run to Cork. With a Coffee and fuel stop before we hit Dublin it was plain sailing all the way.</p>
<p>{{ more }}
We arrived in Cork around 15:30 and meet with Jane Murphy  friend of Flo&rsquo;s to give her a donation to the charity she works for, naturally we did this over coffee.</p>
<p>Next we checked into the hotel and had dinner with Harry, Katherine, Frank and Catherine now we&rsquo;re all set for tomorrow.</p>
<p>After breakfast in the hotel we spent much of the day wandering around the city and a bit of shopping. I relaxed in the Imperial while Flo and Harry watched a very tight ruby match with Ireland just winning by one point with a last minute drop goal by Johnny Sexton.</p>
<p>We all assembled in Rachel Allen&rsquo;s for the family get together. All in a good night made better when Flo announced that Ned was taking care of the bill.</p>
