<p>Before we left Aywaille one more trip to the Jewelers just to view the WRC watch one final time, only for Flo to make the horrendous error of asking the price. Leaving Aywaille lighter of pocket but with a very nice watch.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday 26th</strong></p>
<p>We Arrived at Fuussekaul in good time and where able to procure a suitable spot with good shade for Lotti. The aire takes about 18 vans but the campsite is massive with what look like permanent homes.</p>
<p><strong>Friday 27th</strong></p>
<p>Lovely morning if a bit cold, we set off for our cycle and it turned out to be a fantastic route if a tad hilly. The roads in luxembourg have a suburb surface. Once again Flo did really well on a tough route.
As Flo was so tired we ate at the esso station excellent food in their restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday 28th</strong></p>
<p>Arrived Alzingen just after lunch.</p>

<p>Got set up done some shopping then walked to Itzig where Andy Schleck has opened a bike shop, we looked around and I bought Knog bell and Andy himself served us, Flo getting a photo of the process.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday 29th</strong></p>
<p>Woke up this morning with plans to go cycling when the weather improved but as they say best layed plans received a call from May to inform us that Auntie Norma had died.</p>
<p>Luckily we&rsquo;re right beside Luxembourg Airport so I was able to get a flight home tomorrow with Lux Air.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday 5th</strong></p>
<p>We all headed into Luxembourg for some city sightseeing. The old city is very nice and has been kept well maintained with very little modern influences. Public transport is a dream and we made good use of it. We enjoyed several beers to help with heat, Flo&rsquo;s research payed off once again taking us to the important sights great day.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday 6th</strong></p>
<p>Only a week late but I managed my Alzingen loop this morning, beautiful here temp up to 25c but a bit windy nice ride not as hilly as the previous luxembourg spin still very nice.</p>
