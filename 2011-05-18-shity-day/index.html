<p>The day started badly when updating kzone from my phone while still in bed, the job failed for no reason. After breakfast and much googling and one false start, I discovered that a backup job which ran during the night had copied files locally and filled the drive, after deleting them, all was back to normal. Getting sidetracked I was looking on the web when the monitor went dark. Out came the laptop and PC World had them in stock reserved one to collect and off we went to collect it, guess what, correct none in stock except display models, wasted journey. One now awaits collection in Sprucefield on Friday. Came home and finished taping the bike handle bars not a great job funny tape.</p>
