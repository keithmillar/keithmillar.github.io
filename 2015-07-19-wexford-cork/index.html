After a week in Wexford minding the Keane&rsquo;s house we went to Cork. Naturally Wexford was easy going even with the poor weather, alough we did manage a cycle to Kilmore Quay where Flo finally got her Whippy.</p>
<p>Cork was more stressful got Flo Sr a Freezer plus a few jobs done  around the house. I arranaged a spin with John mostly as a stress buster and we where awarded with one on the best days of the trip. We meet with some of the Aqua Blue guys and did a few miles with before stopping for coffee in Kinsale. That evening we meet with Karen for a Coffee and a walk round the Atlantic Pond.</p>
